<p class="ph2">UNDER THE DESERT STARS</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

THE HYPNOTIC VICTIM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE early spring sun was riding low in the
heavens, going westward to seek its rest.
The haze of twilight was creeping in upon
the city from across the bay and the canyon-like
streets of lower New York were already steeped in
shadow.</p>

<p>Above the city rose the hum of industry and from
the rivers the saucy whistles of tugboats, with their
heavy laden barges, were telling those who would
listen that they, too, were doing their bit.</p>

<p>But all this was lost to the girl standing at the
promenade rail of the Queensborough Bridge, that
massive structure spanning the East River, linking
Brooklyn with New York. The girl, beautiful to an
extreme, both in face and form, stood clutching the
railing with a convulsive grip. Her eyes were set
on something far in the distance and so far as the
passersby were concerned, she was in another world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Curious but hurried glances were aimed at her,
but that was all. New Yorkers are always in a
hurry and a passing glance satisfies the questions that
arise in the minds of most of them.</p>

<p>Carl Lohman, however, was different. His profession
had taught him to observe. So it was natural
that he, noticing the strained attitude of the
girl, should give more than a casual glance. Her
handkerchief had fallen at her feet and he stooped
down to restore it. His action elicited the slightest
notice from her, so he ventured to remark: “I beg
your pardon, Miss, but I believe this is yours.”</p>

<p>At this, the girl slightly turned her head to see
who had spoken to her. Carl noticed, then, the
strange look in her eyes. The fixed stare in them
seemed to be seeking something beyond the vision
of mortal ken. What dream, what strange meditation
had so rudely been broken into?</p>

<p>Mechanically she took one hand from the rail and
accepted the dainty square of lace which Carl extended
to her. A bow, so slight as to be scarcely
perceptible was her only reply. This was but the
outward show. Inwardly she felt relieved to some
extent. A glance told her that this man, with his
intellectual countenance and commanding presence,
was no ordinary flirt. Then, without a word, she
walked away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Carl, believing that the handkerchief had been
dropped with a purpose and curious to know more
about the fascinating girl, hurried to her side and
endeavored to start a conversation.</p>

<p>“Rather a warm day, is it not?”</p>

<p>No answer being given he continued: “Really
tropical for this time of year.”</p>

<p>Again no response. Carl realized that he had
been mistaken. She had not intended to start a
flirtation. He looked at her closely. Yes, that was
it. She was nervous and trembling as from some
all-powerful emotion. He would help her if he
could.</p>

<p>“Madam, you are ill. May I be of some assistance?”
and he extended his arm for support.</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I am all right,” was the rather
testy retort.</p>

<p>“You are a stranger here, are you not?”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him carefully, and hesitatingly
inquired, “Why do you ask? Simply because I did
not reply to your questions?”</p>

<p>“No, not that,” came from Carl; then, “Our
American girls, or rather I should say, New York
girls, resent being addressed by a stranger, even
though he should offer aid when needed.”</p>

<p>“Aid was not and is not now required. And to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
answer your questions, I am a stranger here,” came
swiftly.</p>

<p>“So I thought,” said he, flicking the ashes from
his cigarette.</p>

<p>“What made you think so?” parried the other,
looking at him cautiously from under her heavy
lashes.</p>

<p>“Oh, because. Well, you see women of your type
and eyes are strange here. I have lived here long
enough to learn that.”</p>

<p>“Strange?” she asked, with a forced smile and
shrugging shoulders.</p>

<p>“Yes. Beautifully strange.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” She was beginning to
feel at ease.</p>

<p>“Yes. And as for being a stranger, I would say
you are a European and have not been in this country
very long. At any rate the fads of the moment
have had no effect upon your taste.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she returned with a smile.</p>

<p>“Just here on a visit, if I dare ask?”</p>

<p>Their eyes met. Each was trying to fathom the
mind of the other. For a minute she was silent, then
in a decisive tone of voice she replied, “You are
right. I arrived here a week ago from abroad.”</p>

<p>“From where—abroad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“That is asking questions.” She was fencing for
time.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” frowning.</p>

<p>“You misunderstand me. I mean tell me where
you came from. England?”</p>

<p>“Do I look English?”</p>

<p>“No. Not at all.” Admiring her gift of quick
and thoughtful repartee, he supplemented, “No, you
are neither English nor French.”</p>

<p>“But England and France are not the only countries,
although they like to think so when they do not
require the help of other countries,” she answered
sarcastically.</p>

<p>Their walk had by this time brought them to the
bridge terminal.</p>

<p>“Would you mind calling a taxi?” she asked.</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” he replied, and called a passing
car.</p>

<p>It was with a heart that sank at the answer, that
he asked, at the parting, “May I see you again?”</p>

<p>A smile curved her exquisitely carven lips and
seemed to brighten her face and lend added luster
to her eyes as she slowly shook her head in the
negative.</p>

<p>Carl stepped forward to help her into the taxi,
but before he could realize it, she had gathered her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
skirts, revealing a dainty pair of ankles and entered
the machine. A moment later the door was closed
and the car sped away, leaving Carl standing at the
curb, watching it with charmed eyes.</p>

<p>Hat still in hand, and entirely oblivious of the
curious eyes of those who had witnessed the incident,
he pondered over her lithe and graceful form, the
large fathomless eyes and the subtle charm of her
musical voice. But his heart would have pulsed with
added vigor had he heard, as the taxi started, her
scarcely audible “Auf Wiedersehen.”</p>

<p>A final look at the parting car gave him a pleasing
view of her smiling face, as she gave him a gracious
nod. He bowed and waved his hand in return, murmuring
half aloud, “Some girl!”</p>

<p>Suddenly his musing was rudely broken into by
the passing of a truck and the growled warning from
its driver to get away from the curb. Brought thus
back to the stern world of reality and the commonplace,
he gave his cane a vicious twirl and muttered
beneath his breath, “Damn it! That’s what I call
hard luck”—throwing away his cigarette.</p>

<p>Having given vent to this expletive, he turned and
went his way, seeing nothing but that beautiful smiling
face which was the center and pivot of his confused
mind.</p>

<p>At the Claza, Sana, for that was the name of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
strange girl, alighted from the taxi, and after paying
and dismissing the driver, stepped quickly into
the hotel.</p>

<p>She took the elevator to the eighth floor. But a
change had come over her. Her face was pale and
she was visibly perturbed, as she went down the
corridor.</p>

<p>Her hand sought a door knob, and as she hesitated
for an instance, her perturbation seemed to
leave her. She entered the room without knocking
and as she did so, a middle aged man, François de
Rochelle, looked up in surprise and forced a thin
smile of welcome to his lips.</p>

<p>His words of greeting, “Sana, you are back
again,” must have rung in his own ears with their
true bluntness, so he quickly added, “So soon, mon
cherie?”</p>

<p>He arose from his chair and walking over to
Sana, took her face tenderly in his hands and remarked,
rather peevishly, “You are pale, joujou.
Did not the weather agree with you? I thought the
fresh air blowing over the bridge would do you
good. Did you not go there?”</p>

<p>The contented smile faded from Sana’s face and
was replaced by one of pitiful sadness as she queried
blankly, “Where?”</p>

<p>The far-off stare in the girl’s eyes and her strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
attitude gave de Rochelle food for thought that was
not of the most pleasant kind.</p>

<p>With a scarcely conscious gesture Sana removed
her hat and mechanically walked to the couch where
she sat down, to look with a vacant gaze out of the
window over Central Park. De Rochelle, pushing
aside some papers, sought a seat next to her, and
placing his arm about her shoulder, asked in a voice
that bespoke his own anxiety, “What is it, mon cherie?
What troubles you today? Come, let me feel
your pulse.”</p>

<p>She laughed lightly, although not with contentment,
as his hand encircled her wrist and he placed
his ear upon her chest, in an effort to gauge the pulsations
of her heart.</p>

<p>For a few moments there was a silence between
them. Then de Rochelle, raising his head and looking
straight into her eyes, said, “There is nothing
the matter with you.” Then kissing her, he whispered,
“And your lips are just as sweet as ever.”</p>

<p>Sana, slightly bored, freed herself gently from
his arms, and as she did so, murmured “Oh, it is
nothing.” Throwing her head backward, she added,
“I do not feel very well, but it is beyond me to say
what it is.”</p>

<p>A nameless fear had suddenly arisen within her
heart. Yes, that was it. The fear of speaking to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
him of the incident on the bridge. It would probably
cause him worry and it would rob her of the
delicious dreams she would weave about the man
who was already enthroned in the most secret recesses
of her heart.</p>

<p>So saying no more she rose from the couch, and
left the apartment to go to her own room, leaving
de Rochelle alone, in consternation and uneasy
contemplation.</p>

<p>When she reached her room, Sana threw herself
upon the bed, burying her face in the pillows. Presently,
however, she rose to a sitting posture, and
tangled her fingers madly in her hair, asking herself
unanswerable questions.</p>

<p>“Why should I want to commit suicide? Does
not François love me, and do I not love him with all
my heart? Putting myself away in such a cowardly
manner—would he ever get over it? And then, too,
what of my dear mother?”</p>

<p>Having tortured her mind in that fashion, she
slipped from the bed and approaching the dresser,
she rested her hands heavily upon an open drawer
and glared into the mirror. With piercing eyes she
gazed at herself and gradually a smile came to her
face and a new light gleamed in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Beautifully strange—yes, he was right. I am
too young to die. And I am not going to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>With a determination born of a new and greater
hope, she threw her head back and her long, lustrous
hair, thus shaken loose, unrolled its dark coils down
over her shoulders and far below her waistline.
Her clothes seemed too tight, so she loosened them,
stripping off her outer garment. There was something
sirenic about her beauty as she stood there
with wild-hanging hair, her breasts heaving with excitement.
She commenced to rearrange her disheveled
hair, and a smile crept to her lips as she admired
the reflection in the glass. She was indeed
well aware of her fascinating and dangerous beauty.</p>

<p>And well she might be. The well-rounded neck,
the soft, graciously curved and perfectly proportioned
shoulders and arms, the slight tan of the skin,
the great magic eyes and the pretty face with its
lofty brow, surmounted by waves of dark hair, gave
her the positive stamp of a strange and unique
beauty: a type one so seldom finds to admire. It
was not artificial, nor was it yet exotic—reality was
its only expression.</p>

<p>Standing before the glass, she unconsciously made
a few gestures and movements which held in them a
captivating influence when wielded by one who was
naturally so comely. Unconsciously, too, she took
inventory of her personal charm. It was her
woman’s instinct that told her that all men would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
be her willing slaves, should such a thing be her
desire. But it was not. François was her first
lover, and she wanted him to be the only one.
Everything was to be for him and him alone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most women after they secure the
man for whom they have angled do not know how
to hold their catch. They neglect the very things
that first drew the man to them, they forget their
art in a feeling of possession and security. And then
they wonder why there are so many divorces.</p>

<p>Sana, who was but nineteen, was well versed in
feminine artfulness and had already mastered all its
varied forms and gestures. Her inheritance from
her mother, and the refinement and culture she had
acquired, gave her both finesse and charm in addition
to her amazing loveliness.</p>

<p>Facing the glass, she shook her head and said to
herself, “To destroy myself? Never! Gypsy blood
would not sanction that.”</p>

<p>Sana hastily dressed herself and without advising
de Rochelle of her movements, left the hotel and
sought a friend of hers who lived on 57th Street.</p>

<p>This was a Mrs. O’Brien, a woman, worldly wise
and one who had married young and often. Sana
had met her on the steamer “George Washington,”
on her way from Cherbourg to New York. Mrs.
O’Brien was returning from her latest honeymoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and the chance meeting between the two had ripened
into a most intimate friendship. Regardless of what
gossip may have said about her, Mrs. O’Brien was
real in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>It was to her, therefore, that Sana turned in her
trouble. Mrs. O’Brien listened to Sana’s tale with
a motherly interest, and explaining in part her intentions,
she took Sana to the office of the famous
Dr. White, on the same block.</p>

<p>The doctor, an elderly and affable gentleman, had
been in New York for many years, and the fame
that had preceded him from Europe, where he had
been a professor at the University of Heidelberg,
increased with his years of practice in America.</p>

<p>He and Mrs. O’Brien were well acquainted and
with a cheery “Good evening” he led the two women
from the reception room, into his office, which was
splendidly furnished and embellished with numerous
books, charts and artistic curiosities. There was
nothing about the place to give the visitor the chill
that generally comes on entering a doctor’s office.
Instead the room seemed to be pervaded with an
atmosphere of congenial warmth.</p>

<p>The three seated themselves preparatory to the
consultation. Sana broke the momentary silence by
speaking clearly and calmly.</p>

<p>“My fiancé, François de Rochelle, for whom I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
also work as secretary, induces me daily to walk
across the bridge to get fresh air. Whenever I do
so I always feel a great desire to jump over the rail
and drown myself in the waters below. This sensation
increases, like my love for him, as the days go
by. Why it is, I do not know. I love my fiancé
dearly and he returns my love with equal fervor.
We intend to be married immediately upon our return
to Paris. I do not wish François to be worried
over me, and for that reason I have never confided
in him my desire to commit suicide. Neither have I
mentioned to him my intention to consult a doctor.”</p>

<p>She paused, but Dr. White said only “Yes, go on.”</p>

<p>“Once in a while, of an evening, as a matter of
amusement François hypnotizes me. It always
makes me feel much better. But the following day,
when I walk across the bridge, the horrible impulse
to do away with myself, forces itself upon me. Day
by day the desire increases in intensity. I should
have killed myself today if it had not been for a
man who spoke to me just as I was about to leap
over the rail. Can you tell me what the trouble is,
doctor?”</p>

<p>Dr. White was deep in thought. He had often
practised the subtle art of hypnotism as an aid to
his medical work. He knew, therefore, the sinister
truth that lay behind Sana’s words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Rousing himself at her question, he looked at
Sana closely and asked, “Will you consent to enter
the hypnotic state under my influence?”</p>

<p>Sana recalled to mind some of the risque situations
she had found herself in upon waking from
the trances, induced by her lover. The memories
caused her to pause an instant, then raising her
hands she cried, “No, no!”</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to comprehend the thoughts
that were surging through her mind, and he interrupted
with, “You need have no fear. Your friend,
Mrs. O’Brien is here and the experiment may be of
benefit to both you and your fiancé.”</p>

<p>Her reply to the man’s kindly remonstration
showed how easily he had dispelled her fears.</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps it will be better so.”</p>

<p>Sana reclined restfully back within the cushioned
chair and the doctor bent over her. With his hands
he made a few passes before her face, with a steady
look of intensity he performed the preliminaries of
the hypnotist. His piercing glance held her gaze.
His eyes seemed fairly to devour hers. Soon her
eyes dimmed and slowly commenced to close. Her
mind was giving way to his dominating will. Slowly
the girl’s eyes closed entirely, the muscles of her
body relaxed and her mind sought another plane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Dr. White straightened up and turning to Mrs.
O’Brien said softly, “She is gone.”</p>

<p>The doctor drew his chair close to and directly in
front of Sana. In a clear voice that seemed more
to make itself felt rather than heard, he propounded
his queries.</p>

<p>“What does your fiancé, François de Rochelle,
do when you are under his hypnotic influence?”</p>

<p>Slowly came the answer, “He teaches me some
dance steps and also makes love to me.”</p>

<p>“Do you really love him?”</p>

<p>“Well, I would do anything to please him,
but——”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“I did not love him before we were engaged.”</p>

<p>“How did that happen?”</p>

<p>No answer forthcoming, Dr. White commanded
sharply, “Come, come, answer me.”</p>

<p>Sana responded with “I did not care for him
enough. One evening while at dinner with him in a
private dining-room of a famous Parisian restaurant
he hypnotized me, and directed me to love him
and prepare for our marriage. From then on I began
to love him, and when he was sure of my affection
he disclosed to me the secret of why I loved
him. But I did not mind, for my love was already
deep rooted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Are you wealthy? Did you inherit much
money?”</p>

<p>“No. Just a few thousands.”</p>

<p>“Is your life insured?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for $50,000.”</p>

<p>“Who will get this money in case you die?”</p>

<p>“François.”</p>

<p>“Is de Rochelle’s life insured likewise?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for $10,000.”</p>

<p>Then like a bolt of lightning came the question,
“Did de Rochelle ever direct you to commit suicide
by leaping from the Queensborough Bridge?”</p>

<p>Sana shivered slightly. Her entire body seemed
to shrink as she reached forth her arms and groped
blindly in the empty air.</p>

<p>“Answer me!” The doctor fairly hissed the
words.</p>

<p>In a tone scarce above a whisper came the delayed
reply, “François forbade me to speak on this
subject, should I ever be in a trance induced by any
other than himself. I will not—I cannot answer
that question. I will not!”</p>

<p>“Answer me. Did François direct you to commit
suicide? I demand an answer.”</p>

<p>“I refuse to speak of this matter.”</p>

<p>Finding himself powerless to draw from that unconscious
mind the answer he had hoped to get, Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
White turned to Mrs. O’Brien, his face but thinly
veiling the disappointment he felt.</p>

<p>“Say nothing of this latter question to the girl,”
he cautioned, “it would only serve to distract her.”</p>

<p>He turned to the girl, and once more making a
pass before her eyes, directed, “Wake up.”</p>

<p>Sana opened her eyes, rose to an upright position
and slowly gazed blankly about her. Then recalling
where she was and for what purpose she had come,
a more tranquil look crept into her eyes.</p>

<p>After Sana had recovered herself, Dr. White requested
that she and Mrs. O’Brien call the following
day. To this they readily consented and the appointment
was made.</p>

<p>After Mrs. O’Brien and the girl had left the
office, Doctor White sank into a chair, muttering
“Strange—very strange.”</p>

<p>For a long time he sat there, with his head bowed
in deep thought. Suddenly, he stood up, saying half aloud,
“Professor Grant. That’s the man for this.”</p>

<p>Going to his telephone he called up the professor’s
home.</p>

<p>“Hello, Grant. This is White. Can you possibly
be at my office tomorrow noon? I wish you would
come. I have a most interesting case on my hands—most
interesting.” A pause, then, “You will? Fine.
I knew I could rely upon you. At noon, sharp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The following day Sana and Mrs. O’Brien went
to the doctor’s office. He and Prof. Grant were
waiting for them.</p>

<p>Dr. White introduced Prof. Grant, adding for
Sana’s benefit, “Prof. Grant can be trusted. I am
sure he will be able to help you. Just do as he asks,
and everything will come out all right.”</p>

<p>Sana smiled pleasantly at Prof. Grant, who taking
her by the hand said, “I shall put you under a hypnotic
spell, and while under its influence you must
answer each and every question I put to you. It is
very important and necessary that you do so, for
your own benefit. A cure cannot be effected until
you have spoken as you are bidden. Remember
that.”</p>

<p>“I shall do as you say. Yes, I will. I want to be
cured for the sake of François.”</p>

<p>Little did she dream what the outcome would be.
Sana, of course, knew nothing of the diabolical
schemes of de Rochelle. The victim of hypnotic influence
can never recall to mind, while conscious,
what took place during a trance.</p>

<p>Prof. Grant was a powerfully built man, with a
heavy black beard and a pair of black eyes that
seemed to seek the innermost recesses of the soul.</p>

<p>Taking Sana’s wrist he gazed into her eyes with
a stare that ever increased in piercing power and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
concentration. At first her glance met his frankly,
but within a fleeting moment of time, before she
could realize what was happening, Sana closed her
eyes, and with relaxing muscles sank back in her
chair—totally under the magic spell woven by those
piercing eyes.</p>

<p>Grant came to the point quickly, with “Tell me.
Did your fiancé, François de Rochelle, direct you to
commit suicide while under his influence? What
was the purpose? Tell me.”</p>

<p>Sana hesitated.</p>

<p>Grant fairly shouted, “Answer me. I command
it!”</p>

<p>Slowly the words came, barely audible to the
eager listeners.</p>

<p>“Yes, each time that he hypnotized me he directed
and commanded me to drown myself by leaping
from the bridge into the river. When I was not
under his power, he induced me to walk every day
across the bridge. He told me it would do me good
to get the air. While in a trance, he also forbade
me to ever mention to him, while in a normal state,
of my desire to drown myself. He impressed upon
me, also, that should I ever be under the hypnotic
influence of another and be questioned regarding
this, I was to refuse to answer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Did he ever intimate his purpose in wanting you
to kill yourself?”</p>

<p>“One night he laughed, so I recall, saying that
he would then have plenty of money and could return
to France to marry his schoolday sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” demanded Grant.</p>

<p>“Yes. He even told me her name. I knew her
well. Her name is Edith Durex.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Tell me, how often and for how long has
he been hypnotizing you?”</p>

<p>“Every evening last week.”</p>

<p>“Did you intend carrying out his demands?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I would do anything for François. Only
yesterday was I prevented from doing so by a stranger.
But I will do it as soon as I get the chance.
The feeling grows stronger within me every time I
cross the bridge. And something makes me go to
the bridge each day.”</p>

<p>As Sana gave voice to these strange remarks,
Mrs. O’Brien could hardly suppress her exclamation
“My God!”</p>

<p>Grant and White stepped aside and held earnest
conversation for a moment. Grant spoke decisively,
“The secret is out, and we would be parties to the
crime if we did not take steps to prevent the act.
The girl cannot be allowed to return to de Rochelle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Suppose you ask Mrs. O’Brien to take care of her
for a few days?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that would be best,” and Dr. White
stepped over to Mrs. O’Brien, with the question,
“Do you think you could take your friend to your
home and keep her for a few days? It would be the
means of helping her out of her trouble.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Brien, who was nearly overcome with pity
for Sana, instantly consented, so eager was she to
do something.</p>

<p>“Fine,” from White, giving Grant a slight nod
to indicate that his request had been favorably met.</p>

<p>It was then that Prof. Grant, with a smile on his
face, stepped to the side of the insensible girl. His
voice seemed to ring doubly deep and clear, “From
now on you will never again be possessed of that
desire to commit suicide. You are forever free.”</p>

<p>Taking again her right wrist, he softly said, “It
is all right, madam,” and with a start Sana returned
to consciousness. The happy smile upon her face
told better than words her relief.</p>

<p>As they were about to leave Dr. White stepped to
Sana’s side and said gently, “Miss Sana, please accompany
Mrs. O’Brien to her home. If you wish
to go to the hotel you may do so, but not until after
six o’clock. Do you understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Sana nodded agreeably and assisted by Mrs.
O’Brien she left the two men to their thoughts.</p>

<p>Grant broke the silence. They had been silently
thinking of some plan to follow.</p>

<p>“A letter will do the trick. We shall put the fear
of the Almighty in that rascal’s heart.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s get busy. No time can be lost
in dealing with him.”</p>

<p>The letter was written immediately and dispatched
to the hotel by messenger.</p>

<p>One can only imagine the thoughts that surged
through de Rochelle’s head when he read the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>M. François de Rochelle<br>

New York, N. Y.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Your secretary, Miss Sana, attempted to jump
from the Queensborough Bridge to drown herself,
as directed and demanded of her, while under your
hypnotic influence, so that you could collect the $50,000
insurance and marry your old time sweetheart.</p>

<p>We advise you to leave this city before five
o’clock this evening, as by six o’clock we shall have
reported the case to the District Attorney.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

AT THE MORGUE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE tiny hands of the ormulu clock upon the
mantel told Sana’s anxious heart that it
was a quarter to six.</p>

<p>With a strange presentiment of coming evil that
defied analysis and strongly against the wishes of
her hostess, Sana left the house and hurried to the
hotel.</p>

<p>Reaching de Rochelle’s suite she rapped at the
door. No answer came. A second rapping proved
as futile as the first.</p>

<p>“He is out,” murmured the girl as she sought her
own room. She wanted to rest, but could not. For
fully half an hour she paced the floor, a dreadful oppression
as of some impending catastrophe weighing
down upon her. She could not shake it off. The
very silence of the room seemed to creep into her
heart and dull her mind.</p>

<p>Once more she crossed the corridor to de Rochelle’s
rooms. This time she gave the door a resounding
knock. But still no response. Gently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
almost fearfully, she tried the door. It was unlocked,
so she entered the room.</p>

<p>A strange sight met her eyes. Disorder was
everywhere. The little writing table, usually so
neat and well ordered, was a confusion of jumbled
papers and letters. Signs of a hasty departure were
everywhere.</p>

<p>Sana, however, took it only to mean that some
business interest had called de Rochelle away in a
hurry. Somewhat relieved Sana picked up a book
and going over to the deeply cushioned divan, sat
down to beguile away the time pending his return.
But her mind was in a turmoil and she could not
concentrate on her reading.</p>

<p>Nervously she let the minutes creep past. At last
she could stand the strain no longer. Taking the
phone she called the desk clerk and had him page de
Rochelle. It was of no avail. Again she tried it,
but still the missing man was not to be found.</p>

<p>Beside herself with fear Sana called up Dr.
White, but he assured her that everything was all
right and that no doubt she would hear from de
Rochelle later on. She tried to reason with herself
that there was nothing to fear, but as the hours went
by, each seemingly longer than the one before, she
grew so restless that her anxiety could not be calmed.</p>

<p>She could wait no longer in that lonely room, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
about ten o’clock she hurried over to see Mrs.
O’Brien. To her she related her fears, but she
could do nothing to comfort her or offer any solution.
Alarmed at Sana’s state of mind Mrs.
O’Brien called up Dr. White.</p>

<p>His words, though laconic, conveyed a world of
meaning:</p>

<p>“All is well, and will be for the benefit of Sana.
Keep her at your home tonight.”</p>

<p>But Sana would not listen to any such suggestion.
Her alarm had increased three-fold and although
Mrs. O’Brien did everything to persuade her to remain,
Sana hurried back to the hotel.</p>

<p>She felt sure that by this time her sweetheart
would have returned. But the desk clerk had
neither seen nor heard anything of him.</p>

<p>Once more she found herself within the precincts
of his apartment. She could hardly keep from
screaming aloud in her misery.</p>

<p>Her eyes roved around the empty room, faltered
in their course, and the wandering gaze became a
fixed stare. She had found a clew!</p>

<p>Upon the radiator she saw a bit of charred paper.
She bent over it, studying it intently. But the message
it had carried was illegible. A handful of black
ashes. What was their secret? She did not touch
them, but took a match, and kneeling on the floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
slowly turned the charred paper around with the
match in an effort to decipher something. Here and
there a word could be seen, but nothing to convey
any meaning to her fevered brain. She lit the match
and holding it back of the legible letters managed to
read “tell clerk” “Sana” “leave,” but that was all.</p>

<p>Deeply puzzled and not knowing what to make of
it, she lighted another match, hoping to decipher
other words. But before she had realized it, the
flame caught the unburned part of the paper and destroyed
it completely.</p>

<p>Unmindful of everything she sat on the floor, puzzled
and heartbroken.</p>

<p>Brought to her senses by the chiming of midnight,
the confused girl sought her room. Almost unconsciously
she disrobed and threw herself upon the
bed. Through the long hours of the night she lay
with unclosed eyes and with every nerve strained to
catch the sound of the returning footsteps of the one
she loved so dearly. But she listened in vain. The
dawn of the new day crept in upon her as she lay
there given up to the grief that was hers.</p>

<p>She arose and called the desk clerk. He was
sorry, but he could get no response from de Rochelle’s
rooms, in spite of his efforts to do so.</p>

<p>Mechanically Sana dressed, walking about the
room without intention or aim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>It was a little after six when she again entered de
Rochelle’s room. It was still unoccupied—unoccupied,
but yet tenanted with an almost tangible
shadow—the presence of silence.</p>

<p>The thought that de Rochelle had deliberately
deserted her did not enter Sana’s mind for quite a
time. When it did, it tended to clear her brain, lend
calmness to her being. She made a brave attempt
to figure it out, saying to herself, “What for? And
if so, what will become of me? What shall I do
in this strange city?” And her thoughts went back
to Paris and her childhood days, when she had
someone to watch over her and guide her footsteps.</p>

<p>Sana realized her helplessness. She was alone.
Dear as she was, her friend Mrs. O’Brien could not
help her, nor could she help solve the mystery of
de Rochelle’s absence. So she looked around the
rooms once more and left.</p>

<p>In a trembling voice, she questioned the desk
clerk, “Have you had any word from Mr. de
Rochelle?”</p>

<p>The clerk was perusing the morning paper as she
put the question to him. He started violently, gazed
intently into her face, then back at the paper.
Finally he said “de Rochelle? Is this the de Rochelle
you mean?” And with a pencil he marked
a column in the paper and handed it to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Her worst fears were more than realized as she
read the tragic headlines:</p>



<p class="ph1">BRIDGE JUMPER SUCCEEDS<br>
FRANÇOIS DE ROCHELLE</p>

<p class="center">of</p>

<p class="center">SAHARA DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION<br>
DROWNED LAST NIGHT IN EAST RIVER<br>
NEAR QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE<br>
ADDRESS UNKNOWN</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Boys playing on the water front last night discovered
a man’s body floating toward the shore and
with the help of a policeman it was soon recovered.
The face was greatly disfigured, due to his striking
the bridge pilaster. The body was removed to the
morgue....</p>
</div>

<p>Sana grew pale. Great tears forced themselves
from the deep seas of her eyes and the paper, falling
from her limp grasp fluttered to the floor. The
clerk, noticing this, hastily walked from behind his
desk and reached Sana just in time to catch her as
she fell in a dead faint.</p>

<p>A small crowd of early hotel guests soon gathered
about Sana. Among them was the hotel doctor,
who ordered that the girl be at once taken to her
room. A nurse was summoned and with her aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the physician soon revived Sana. Quiet and rest,
he said, were all that would be required to restore
the weakened girl to a normal condition.</p>

<p>That morning, Mrs. O’Brien, breakfasting with
her husband, read of the drowned man in the paper.
Believing that Dr. White had been implicated in
some foul play, she at once sought him out. Yes,
he had read of it, but was as much puzzled as she.</p>

<p>Together they called on the prostrate Sana. She
was lying on her bed weeping and softly calling the
name of her lover. The couple sought to explain,
and hoped, in doing so, to mitigate the horror of
the catastrophe. But the attempt was fruitless, the
girl refused to be comforted or quieted. Realizing
the futility of their desires, they took their leave,
feeling the worse for so painful and depressing a
call. They decided, however, to call later in the
day.</p>

<p>About noon Mrs. O’Brien and Dr. White again
called to see Sana. Their explanations were lost on
the girl. She could not comprehend and she feared
to believe. All she would say was, half to herself
“François, François, come to me. I need you so.”</p>

<p>As time went by, however, Sana became calmer
under the soothing words of her friends, and the
three, together with Prof. Grant, who had been
summoned, went to the District Attorney’s office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>When they had been seated in the private office
of that official, Sana and the others were greatly
surprised at the attitude he immediately assumed.
Without hesitation, he proceeded to implicate Sana
in the death of de Rochelle. His questioning was
ruthless and his accusations most bitter. From his
words one would gather that Sana was the guilty
one—that in some way or other she had contrived to
put her sweetheart out of the way.</p>

<p>The processes of our law are peculiar, and to a
stranger, as Sana was, to such methods, it was indeed
difficult to understand. She had undergone a
severe nervous strain—a terrible shock—and, naturally,
was far from being in a calm collected state
of mind. It was this nervousness, then, that had led
the man to believe her guilty of some crime. Peculiar?
Yes, to be sure—but many a man has come
to realize that justice is more than blindfolded!</p>

<p>Dr. White, although quite familiar with incidents
of this sort, was outraged at the procedure. Knowing,
as he did, the true circumstances of the case,
he could bear it no longer. His agitation was demonstrated
clearly, when, in a cold, cutting voice, he
interrupted the questioner with, “This young lady
knows absolutely nothing as to the why and wherefore
of de Rochelle’s death. At the time of his
disappearance, she was at the home of Mrs. O’Brien.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
It is clear, then, that you are injuring her with your
accusations.”</p>

<p>At this, the tide of questions turned to overwhelm
the O’Briens. Suffice to say, it was easy for them
to establish an alibi both for Sana and themselves.</p>

<p>Dr. White was next to face the fire of the attack.
His explanations with regard to the dead man’s
hypnotic influence over Sana, served only to add fuel
to the flames. A barrage of questions were hurled
at him in an effort to trick him into saying something
that might be used against him or one of the
others. White, however, was too clever a man, and
knowing just what he was up against, successfully
parried the thrusts of his opponent.</p>

<p>The outcome was, that, failing to secure any satisfaction
from his visitors, the District Attorney
bowed them out, mumbling, “Well, it will be investigated
further.”</p>

<p>Leaving the place, the party wended their way to
the morgue, to make an effort to identify the body.</p>

<p>There are moments when long restrained grief
and anxiety break loose from the mortal fetters that
bind them—they escape the chains, though in their
flight they rend the soul and tear the heart. Such
a moment came to Sana as she stood in the house
of the dead, awaiting her turn to look at the body
of the drowned man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>She freed herself from the supporting arm of
Mrs. O’Brien and with a cry of anguish pushed her
way to the body lying upon the rude slab.</p>

<p>Silently she gazed upon the form. The facial
features were wholly unrecognizable and his curly
hair, through which she had so often delightedly
run her fingers now was matted with dried and
clotted blood. The eye that had fascinated her—the
lips that had so often sought hers—all these
were hideously mutilated.</p>

<p>Sana sank to her knees and fell across the body,
sobbing, “François, François come back—come back
to me—your Sana—your joujou. O François, why
did you leave me? I loved you so. Oh! look at
me.”</p>

<p>And as she raved she peered with pitying intent
into the sunken eyes of the lifeless man.</p>

<p>“Come, my child, we must be going,” burst upon
the ears of the anguished girl, as she moaned and
wrung her hands hysterically over the form of her
dead love.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came from lips unconscious of the utterance.</p>

<p>“François, I must leave you—François, goodbye—goodb——”</p>

<p>With her farewell uncompleted Sana fell in a
swoon at the feet of Professor Grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>They carried her into the office, and after regaining
consciousness she was led to the waiting automobile
in which she was taken to Mrs. O’Brien’s
home.</p>

<p>The following day a representative of the insurance
company called upon the O’Briens to hand Sana
a check for the ten thousand dollars insurance on de
Rochelle’s life, of which Sana was the beneficiary.</p>

<p>Sana looked at the check with a feeling of disgust,
and finally passed it back to the man saying,
“I don’t want his money.”</p>

<p>“But it is not his money,” came the answer, “It
is the insurance company’s money.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want it anyway.”</p>

<p>“But what shall I say at the office?”</p>

<p>“Tell them I shall let them know in a few days.
Perhaps I shall donate it to some charity.”</p>

<p>At this display of pride, the agent muttered something
about her being an exception, and at a signal
from Mrs. O’Brien, who noticed that Sana was becoming
nervous, he left the room.</p>

THE MOON-SHINERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SANA was confined to a sick-bed for several
weeks, at the home of Mrs. O’Brien, following
the visit to the morgue. The tragedy
had well nigh shattered her nerves and only
the most careful attention on the part of her host
and Dr. White prevented a serious breakdown.
But none could be more considerate than they, and
though slowly and through periods of great suffering,
Sana regained her strength.</p>

<p>When at last she was able to be up and about in
the open air, Mrs. O’Brien prevailed upon her to
accept her invitation to go with the O’Brien family
to their bungalow in the Catskills. New York was
sweltering. It was late in August and at times the
thermometer would show one hundred in the shade.</p>

<p>At the earnest pleading of her friend, Sana smiled,
“Oh, you are so good—you are the kindest woman
I ever met.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Brien laughed at that, saying, “My dear
child, it is easy to be kind to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“I’m sure I don’t know why I am imposing upon
you so much.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Brien stroked Sana’s hair and replied,
“Don’t let us talk about it. You simply come along.
Your being with us will be ample reward.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that is the way you feel about it, I surely
cannot refuse. Yes, I shall be glad to go with you.”</p>

<p>“Now you are showing the proper spirit.” She
rang a bell, adding, “I shall tell the maid to pack at
once. We can’t get away from here quick enough to
suit me. Perhaps you didn’t know but Mr. O’Brien
is on his way to the mountains already, to get things
in order.”</p>

<p>The next morning they were soon on board the
river steamer, sailing up the majestic Hudson.</p>

<p>It was an ideal day for a river trip. The two
women seated well forward on the upper deck
basked in the warm sunshine, which, tempered by
the cooling breeze that came down river, seemed so
utterly different from the sweltering sun that beamed
on the city’s paved streets that they could readily
have believed themselves to be in another land.
Sana was very much interested in a book she had
brought with her and Mrs. O’Brien likewise read
from the various magazines she had purchased at
the dock. So the morning hours fled quickly by, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
quickly indeed that but few words passed between
them before the dinner call was sounded.</p>

<p>The stimulating hours spent on deck had given
them a hearty appetite. They ate leisurely and contentedly,
Mrs. O’Brien more than once commenting
on the change that had already been wrought in
Sana.</p>

<p>Returning to the deck they resumed their chairs
and books. Reading soon became tiresome, however,
and they fell to talking of this, that and what-not,
as will two ladies at any time.</p>

<p>The boat was now sailing the upper reaches of
the river; with the mountains in the distance. Sana
suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>“This reminds me of a journey I once took up
the Rhine. Only the castles and winefields which
lend an added interest and romance to that historic
river, are missing here.”</p>

<p>“True, my dear,” from Mrs. O’Brien, “but the
homes of our millionaires answer the purpose of the
castles. As for the vineyards—they are ‘verboten,’
as the saying is, since our country has gone dry.”</p>

<p>It was with a curious questioning glance, her head
turned sidewise toward her companion, that Sana
said, “But there is always wine at your home?
Where does it come from?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my husband takes care of that. He used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
to import his wines from France and Germany, but
that, of course, cannot be done now. So we have to
do the next best thing and that is buy it from those
who manage to get it into the country. As for
stronger liquors, anyone who has the price can get
all they wish. England attends to supplying us with
her national drinks, so we get all the whiskey and
brandy we wish. The English have seen what a
wonderful market they have here for their goods—wet
goods, you understand, and they are taking the
opportunity to make the best of it.”</p>

<p>This was all news to Sana, and she was content
to let her friend go on with her story.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Special ‘rum-ships’ are operated
under the usual English governmental protection.
These ships come within a few miles from shore, remaining
just far enough outside to be beyond the
reach of the Federal authorities. ‘Rum-runners’—fast
motorboats—go out to these ships, get a cargo,
and under cover of darkness or a favorable fog,
transport it to the land of liberty.”</p>

<p>“How is it they can smuggle in this contraband
when your government is so efficient and all your
authorities so honest in carrying out the law?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, child. Many of those authorities,
although appearing thoroughly honest on the face of
things, get their rake-off. Every so often we read,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in the papers, of some such authority being caught
at just that sort of thing. Why, some of those fellows
are getting rich on the graft. It seems to me
that laws of that kind are always enacted for just
one purpose. And that is that certain politicians,
or preferably their friends, may enrich themselves
at the expense of the general public. The rich today
can get all the liquor they want, but part of the price
they pay goes into the pockets of some grafter.</p>

<p>“It was always the same. Why I remember the
time, some ten years ago, a law was put into effect
to control the sale of drinks on Sundays. Food had
to be served with the drinks to keep within the law.
It was a farce. The protective police and their go-betweens
took the graft, and the sandwich which
was served with the drinks went back and forth between
the bar and the tables, acting simply as a
chaperon. The same sandwich was served a hundred
times or so, before it ended its career in the
garbage pail. Provided, of course, some hungry individual,
short a dime for food, would not swallow
it with his whiskey.”</p>

<p>From Sana, “Why, I thought people in this country
always voted on issues of this kind—that is, if
the people wanted the country dry, they would decide
it and not the government, the servant of the
people, and that for this reason you call it a democracy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Only then could it, in truth, be called a ‘government
of the people, by the people, and for the
people.’ Also, I believe you call it ‘The Sweet Land
of Liberty.’ What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“My dear child, it can readily be seen that you
have not been here long.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. O’Brien, surely you do not mean to tell me
that the people of this great country have nothing
to say in matters of this kind? If that is so, could
their opinions count with the government in matters
of less importance than the stability of society?
Stranger as I am, I have noticed how big an increase
there has been in crime and other matters that can
be laid directly at the door of this law. The absence
of light alcoholic drinks has had an effect not
to be smiled at. I wonder why doctors, surely men
of learning and understanding, prescribe such stimulating
drinks to their patients. Is it to further
weaken their bodies and characters or to strengthen
them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sana, I know, we do not have the logic
others have, or rather I should say, we have no logic
at all. Common sense is thrown to the winds every
four years during election campaigns and twice in
the interim; therefore of what use is it to think?
Seemingly a waste of time. Politicians, as well as
others representing various interests, will state facts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
or untruths, for that matter, one day and contradict
them the next just to suit their interests, so the people
absolutely do not know where they stand. And
when a final issue is to be decided, the rogues step
in and find it very easy to lead the dear public by
the nose.</p>

<p>“Why, they do not even know the correct time,—our
very clocks contradict themselves. Take the ten
o’clock train, for instance. After running for five
minutes in an effort to catch it, you find it is only a
few minutes past nine or eleven. You see, it is all
part of the game. The people must have no fixed
ideas. Their minds must be as pliable as dough—to
suit the interests. That is what they do not understand,
as yet, in other countries. But at the same
time, the public must be told over and over again
that they are the foremost and freest people on the
face of the globe and that settles it, as sure as the
‘amen’ in the church.”</p>

<p>“And these persons, running things like that, get
away with it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sana, they do, but they are only so very few
that the rest do not mind them. But should one
mind them, he will be a ‘marked man,’ like Tom
Lawson who exposed the frenzies of high finance
in Wall Street in his famous novel ‘Friday the Thirteenth.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
First they drove him from his large operations
to smaller ones. Finally they ‘broke’ him.
The recent sale of his four million dollar estate
‘Dreamwold’ was the last of the tragedies of Lawson’s
life. And the same tactics are used with others
in political life. They get them in the long run, even
if things have to be ‘framed,’ as many records show.
I could tell you more, but I must not. Someone
might overhear me and I would get myself in difficulties,
even though proofs are available. They may
do anything to you, but you must not get back at
them, no matter how right you are. You know, it
hurts their feelings to know the truth, but don’t expect
them to show any feeling for you. But to get
back to the liquor question, Sana. I have several
recipes with me, for very good drinks. I got them
from the Duncans, friends of mine, you know.
They have been making home-brew ever since the
country went dry. The stuff they make is good and
has a decided kick to it. I have had some several
times at their home. I enjoy a good drink once in a
while myself, you know.</p>

<p>“I brought copies of the recipes with me. You
never know who you might meet and it is always
good to be able to compare notes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Brien, after searching a few minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
among the puffs, rouge boxes and other miscellany
that filled her hand bag drew out two slips of paper
which she handed to Sana.</p>

<p>“Here they are, you may keep a copy. Might
come in handy when your own country goes dry.”</p>

<p>Sana looked at the papers for a moment, then
commenced to read, “Peach Wine—one pound
evaporated peaches, two pounds sugar....”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Brien interrupted her with a hasty “Shh.
Shh. Not so loud. It is against the law for people
to know how to do things.”</p>

<p>Sana laughed heartily as she cried, “Oh, es ist
verboten!”</p>

<p>She resumed her reading and having finished
looked up with “So that is what the people make in
order to get what the government doesn’t wish them
to have?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s good stuff—a peach of a drink. Read
the other.”</p>

<p>Sana did as she was told, then laughingly, “I see
you people have found a good use for that one-time
useless weed to serve the pressing need of the populace.
But, if I recall aright, I saw in the papers a
few days ago that the government decided that even
the poor defenceless dandelion came within the ban
of the prohibition laws. Now that decision is being
enforced I am sure that your law-abiding citizens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
will see to the banishing of that innocent flower from
the vacant lots.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the question will be, who is first on the lot,
I or my neighbor?”</p>

<p>“Has the dandelion drink a strong kick, as you
call it?”</p>

<p>“A decided one. They tell me that one can get
tipsy and even ‘stewed’ on it, and were one to drink
enough of it, he would be ‘soused,’” Mrs. O’Brien
laughed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny? Pretty soon the government will
order your people not to eat any apples, because, as
you know, there are some people who become intoxicated
on eating that fruit.”</p>

<p>“That is so. I have seen many a time, as a child,
in the country, a goat drunk from eating apples, and
it would run around at full speed, ending up by butting
its head into trees—much to my delight.”</p>

<p>Sana, smiling in anticipation of her next remark,
continued the subject, “I presume the prohibition
law has got the ‘goat’ of many of your people.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of those who cannot afford to lay in a
stock now and then. Ten dollars a quart is a steep
price. But as you can see from the recipes, there is
a way around. As I said, I have often thought that
many of our laws are purposely made to be evaded,
so that the grafters can get their rake-off. We find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
ways to aid them. One thing is sure. The people
are paying the piper and it has always been so in
this country. Now, they have taken the sunshine
out of our homes and let the moonshine in.”</p>

<p>“I see. After all, you people do some scheming,
it seems, to get some small liberties in spite of what
seems to be, in reality an autocratic government.
Now, that drinking even light alcoholic beverages is
an offense, and something not to be tolerated, I suppose
they will pass a law making it unconstitutional
to indulge in tobacco. Then what will the people
do?”</p>

<p>“Do? Why, nothing, so far as eliminating the
law is concerned, but as for obeying it—well, you
know. The more the law is disregarded the bigger
the graft, and the bigger the graft the more successful
the law. But I really do not know what it will
lead to. I guess you are right, and after they have
taken care of our smoking, some hypocrite will attempt
to do away with coffee and tea.”</p>

<p>Sana laughed, “Well there would be more sense
in that. Some people cannot sleep after drinking
coffee, while a glass of good beer does much to induce
sleep. The caffeine in coffee is a dope, while
there is no nourishment in the drink itself. That
could not be said of any malt beverage.”</p>

<p>“Sana, you spoke of such things getting our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
‘goat.’ That reminds me of a good story. I do not
believe you know this, but my brother Pat was in the
saloon business. He was quite prosperous, too, and
a law-abiding citizen in every respect of the word.
He never did a mean trick in his life and was a respected
member of our church. Then came prohibition—which
by the way was rather a surprise to
the returning soldiers. They had been wined in
France, to their heart’s content, but when they returned
to their own country they found they had
criminal intentions if they tried to get a drink.
Well, Pat went broke. He couldn’t be honest and
make a living at the only trade he knew. And what
made him so sore was that, as he expressed, the biggest
bootlegger put him out of business. You remember
that there was a time when dear England
had her back against the wall and was crying to
America for men and ships. It is a matter of history
as to how willingly and well we responded to
that plea. Well, as a matter of gratitude, England,
greatly against her will, allowed us to keep, for ourselves,
a few former German vessels that had been
tied up at our docks during the war—they were not
allowed coal for quite some time prior to our entering
into the war so they didn’t get away. Well, we
got those boats and, of course, we had the privilege
of retaining and using the wooden boats we built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
during the war. That was about all we got for the
billions of dollars we loaned and the thousands of
lives that were lost on the fields of battle. And
what good were those boats when we could not successfully
cope with vessels flying the flags of other
nations? That is where Uncle Sam turned bootlegger.
The boats running under foreign registry carried
liquor—that was the whole situation in a nutshell.
Americans would not travel on ‘dry’ boats
when they could get liquor on others. So it came
to pass that American vessels were allowed to carry
liquors for the convenience of the passengers. And
it was a good idea. It kept American money where
it belongs—in America.</p>

<p>“But it didn’t last for long. Complications arose
so that Washington ruled that our American vessels
must not have liquor aboard.</p>

<p>“But while it did last, Uncle Sam was a bootlegger—serving
the interests of a few—the ship owners,
and Pat and the rest of us footed the bill, by
paying heavier taxes to make up for the losses incurred
by the Government when the closing of the
breweries, distilleries and saloons wiped out many
millions of dollars income in the way of internal
revenue. And making law breakers of honest
citizens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Why don’t the people protest against such reactionary
laws?”</p>

<p>“Their ‘state of mind’ won’t allow them. It’s a
case of follow the leader all the time. Why, in their
treatment of their own neighbors this can be seen.
Prior to the war, the Germans for instance, were
credited as being a people possessed of sound logic;
hard working, intelligent and above-board. The
German-Americans in this country were respected as
good citizens, hard workers, and held a high place
in the esteem of their fellowmen. When the war
came they did not change—it was our ‘state of mind’
that changed. Another case of follow the leader.
Guided by a few we arose against them, abusing and
accusing them shamefully. Every Tom, Dick and
Harry felt self-ordained to search out their innermost
secrets. There was a perfect orgy of tale bearing
and envious tattling. The police department of
one city reported receiving as many as fifteen thousand
letters in one day from people wishing to report
actions of their neighbors. Actions and words
that had passed unnoticed for years, were suddenly
found to be treacherous.</p>

<p>“And so it is with everything. The controlling
caste makes one believe things—and if you believe
it, it’s so. Barnum was right.”</p>

<p>“Who was Barnum and what did he say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Barnum was an American circus man. He had
been in the business for many years and in his contact
with the American people he had learned to
know them better than anyone else could have done.
When asked the secret of his success in dealing with
the American people, he summed up with the phrase,
‘The people want to be fooled.’ And another
American, a leading railroad man, said, ‘the public
be damned!’ So, there you have it.”</p>

<p>An hour or so more of inconsequential conversation
passed between the two women and the boat
was docking at Albany.</p>

<p>“Come, Sana,” urged Mrs. O’Brien, “let’s hurry
to the hotel. We can get a bite to eat before Mr.
O’Brien calls for us. And perhaps we can see
whether this town is any drier than New York.”</p>

<p>The hotel dining-room was quite crowded, and
they noticed that there was more than the usual air
of hilarity about the place. On several tables were
what appeared to be—real highballs!</p>

<p>This sight interested Mrs. O’Brien to such an extent
that when the waiter came for their order she
remarked, “George—what kind of nice drink can
we have?”</p>

<p>“Well, we has ginger ale, lemonade, buttermilk—all
what you sees on the card,” indicating the beverage
list of the menu—“Yassum, all those.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“But I mean something more substantial—something
like they have,” and she motioned with her
head toward a party of women at a table nearby.</p>

<p>“Oh, them there ladies done brought their own
substantials.”</p>

<p>“You mean in their hip pockets”—correcting herself,
“in their own flasks?”</p>

<p>“Sure enough, ma’am—but....”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you might be able to fix us up?”</p>

<p>The waiter studied the two for a moment, then,
assured that he could take a chance, replied, “Guess
I can,” and prepared to go.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Brien halted him with “Good stuff, remember,
and some ginger ale.”</p>

<p>“Good stuff is right, ma’am. Government goods,
made before the war,” and he was gone.</p>

<p>Shortly he returned with their food, a bottle of
ginger ale and a small flask wrapped in a napkin.
The latter he placed at the side of Mrs. O’Brien’s
plate, and without further ado was away to attend
to other duties.</p>

<p>After pouring the contents of the flask, about a
half pint, into their glasses, Mrs. O’Brien studied the
label on the bottle and with a smile read “For medicinal
purposes only.” “Yes, rye whiskey, bonded by
the government about two months ago. You see
what I mean by the ‘state of mind’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>During the meal, enlivened by the cheering cup,
they heard snatches of the conversations of nearby
diners. All were speaking of the liquor situation.
One woman admitted that prior to the country going
dry she never thought of drinking, now she couldn’t
get enough. A man remarked that he and others,
belonging to his club, were operating under protection.</p>

<p>When the check was presented Mrs. O’Brien
noted that the whiskey was not charged for. But the
waiter stood there with his hand resting on the
table, three fingers pointed ceilingward—“Three
dollars extra for the substantials.”</p>

<p>The bill paid and the waiter gone, pleased with a
generous tip, the two strolled about in the lobby.</p>

<p>After a few minutes wait Mr. O’Brien put in
appearance.</p>

<p>Soon the three were seated in the Benz he had
brought with him from Europe, and after taking
Sana to see the State Capitol, they went spinning
over the roads towards their lodge in the Catskill
forests.</p>

<p>The mountain life did Sana a world of good.
Mrs. O’Brien loved the outdoor life and would give
Sana no rest. She would rout her out of bed early
in the morning and the two would go for a tramp
across hill and valley. Then again there would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
tennis game to be played, or a ride on horseback
that could be put off no longer. Sana rode well, in
fact her riding was the envy of all who saw her.
Many a long ride was had over the picturesque
mountain roads—down old Rip Van Winkle’s trail—down
through the wonderfully beautiful Kaaterskill
Canyon, or over to Haines Falls, Tannersville
and Prattsville, formerly the center of America’s
tanning industry, and where today there stands a
monument, just outside the village, dedicated to
Pratt, the founder, in the form of a statue cut out
of the living rock.</p>

<p>So employed, the remaining summer days went all
too fast for Sana, and the cold mountain days drew
on. But with their coming returned all Sana’s
youthful vigor and charm. Her face glowed with
the wine of life and her eyes sparkled like winter
stars.</p>

<p>Before returning to New York the O’Briens took
Sana to see Niagara Falls. “The greatest sight in
the world,” chortled Mr. O’Brien, “and it’s American.”
And Sana agreed with him.</p>

<p>Sana spent the winter with Mrs. O’Brien, a winter
that sped quickly, broken up as it was with trips to
Boston, Washington, Cleveland, Chicago and other
American cities, as well as a protracted stay at Atlantic
City—the year round pleasure resort. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
way Sana came to know America better than most
Americans do in a lifetime.</p>

<p>With the spring came a desire to return to Paris.
Her friends did what they could to dissuade her,
but to no avail. So reluctantly they consented.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Brien insisted that the day before sailing
be spent at Coney Island. Sana must see it, he told
Mrs. O’Brien when she frowned down the suggestion.
She knew that he was just as anxious for himself
as for Sana, but she at last consented—thankful,
in her heart, that he had made the suggestion, because
it was years since she had been there and
though she would not admit it, it was only her “state
of mind” that kept her from going there before.
But of course, he mustn’t know just how she felt
about it.</p>

<p>There was no happier crowd at the Island that
day than their little party. They “shot the chutes”—got
lost in the maze, and did all the things they
thought they never would do—but that’s the spirit
of the Island. In like spirit they joined the multitude
in eating the famous “hot dog and sauerkraut,”
or as Mr. O’Brien called it, “liberty cabbage.” He
regretted this remark, because his better half broke
in with “I suppose in the broadmindedness you have
acquired since the war you call these frankfurters
‘liberty dogs.’ Don’t you have enough liberties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
forced down your throat without applying them to
your food? Put some mustard on your liberties and
the dogs will taste better.”</p>

<p>The following day the O’Briens accompanied
Sana to the steamship pier to say “goodbye.”</p>

<p>Parting they exacted a promise that she would
soon return to America and visit them. Readily
Sana agreed, little dreaming of how the riddle of
her life was to be solved by the Fates that guide us
from the cradle to the grave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

IN SPORTING EUROPE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was evening when Sana arrived in Paris.
The weary railroad trip from the seaboard had
made her rather tired, so instead of looking
around for less expensive accommodations she went
at once to the Hotel Mercedes, facing the Place de
l’Etoile.</p>

<p>In her room, she spent the next hour or so removing
the stains of travel and then, fresh as a rose,
set forth to satisfy the cravings of hunger that were
making themselves quite apparent. She gave the
hotel dining-room but a passing glance. No, that
would not do. Paris already had her in its grip!
She must seek gayety and refreshment. Ah! The
very place. The Café de Paris. Here she would
surely meet someone of past acquaintance. For the
Café was noted for the pleasure it afforded and also
for the excellence of the food. Some friend of hers
would surely be there.</p>

<p>Her assumptions proved correct. Hardly had
she seated herself when a gentleman at an adjoining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
table spoke rather loudly, “Well, if it isn’t Mademoiselle
Sana!”</p>

<p>Sana turned her head and recognized the speaker
as a Mr. Johns, an Englishman and a friend of the
head of the Companie le Developpement du Sahara.
His companion was an elderly lady of distinct refinement
and apparent wealth. In response to his
polite bow Sana smiled back “Bon soir!”</p>

<p>Mr. Johns rose and came over to her table with
an invitation to join his companion and himself at
dinner. To this Sana gladly consented.</p>

<p>Mr. Johns introduced his companion as the
Princess Cassandra, adding in way of explanation,
“Left Russia in time to escape the Soviets.”</p>

<p>The Princess was sipping black coffee, evidently
preparing to keep awake the coming night. This
she made clear to Sana by saying that they had the
entire night before them and intended to wind up
at Maxim’s. When they invited her to go with them
Sana, pretending fatigue, begged to be excused.
But her pleas were useless; she must go, so she
finally agreed. Her first night again in gay Paris!</p>

<p>Finished dining, they left the Café and went to
the Thêátre Chatelet to see the Ballet. The performance
ended, the party went slumming through
the Latin quartier, eventually finding themselves,
about three in the morning, at Maxim’s. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the place the Princess had been so anxious to see.
Sana had been there before and knew what to expect
in the way of dancing, and feminine display.</p>

<p>But all parties must come to an end, so the rosy
fingered Dawn, tinting the east, finds Sana saying
goodbye to her friends, a thoroughly tired but happy
girl.</p>

<p>Sana soon renewed the acquaintance of many old
friends, but her stay in Paris was short. Too short
perhaps to suit the many admirers of the lovely
girl! The Princess Cassandra had been attracted to
the girl from the start and after much urging she
secured Sana’s consent to accompany her as a companion
on a tour of the continent.</p>

<p>Together they visited the great cities and famous
resorts. Delighted as she was with the companionship
of the girl, Cassandra gained in another direction.
Sana proved a great attraction to the younger
aristocrats of the places they visited. And it is easily
seen that with such a host of admirers at Sana’s
beck and call, it was hardly possible that some of
them should not fall to the lot of the Princess, even
though it be considered charity on the part of the
man.</p>

<p>Wealth alone does not draw in circles of their
kind, and Cassandra, still beautiful for her age, recognized
the advantages of having Sana at her side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
It was the philosophy of a homely woman making
it her business to associate with a beautiful and
charming girl. She might be left out of the play
once in a while—when but one attendant was at
hand. But when more than one put in an appearance
she had the chances which, otherwise, she
would never get. Many a mother with a marriageable
daughter plays this role and not unconsciously.
One seldom finds the grouchy, business-worn husband
on the scene.</p>

<p>But regardless of the Princess’ aims, these new
associations brought Sana recreation and forgetfulness
of the past.</p>

<p>It was a daily experience of Sana’s to make new
friends. Hers was a beauty and charm that none
could resist. And few, if any, made any serious attempt
to keep on resisting!</p>

<p>At Monte Carlo—that haven of chance, that has
seen the birth of so many romances and their death,
Sana met Count von Sarnoff, a nephew of the Princess.
Von Sarnoff was nothing more or less than a
sporting lounge-lizard, ever ready to call the tune
but never willing to pay the piper.</p>

<p>With him it was a case of love at first sight.
Sana, however, was in no mood to respond to his
protestations of sincere love. Too bitterly disastrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
had been the result of her first love and too
fresh her memory of it.</p>

<p>Von Sarnoff, however, was not to be put off so
easily. He kept continually showering her with
messages of his affection, voicing his sentiments in
ardent notes, accompanied by exquisite bouquets and
rare gifts. He gave, with the moneyed aid of his
aunt, the Princess, a series of elaborate entertainments
in Sana’s honor. Persistent as he was in his
effort to win her love, his determination availed
nothing.</p>

<p>One evening, as he knelt at her feet, holding her
hand, Sana unburdened herself of her true feelings.</p>

<p>“As much as I admire you, my dear boy,” she
said earnestly, “I could not think of marriage. I
want to be free, and after all, I do not care a great
deal for this gay life.”</p>

<p>He broke in, pleadingly, “But, Sana, we can give
up this sort of life and return to my estates in Russia
to live a quiet life.”</p>

<p>“Live quietly in Russia!” Sana smiled, “you propose
the impossible! Are not the Bolshevists after
your very skin and did you not flee for your life?
Were not your estates taken away? And now you
propose to take me to that very place!”</p>

<p>“Do not treat the matter lightly, my beloved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Come with me, my queen. My parents will be only
too delighted to receive you as their daughter.”</p>

<p>“But what would your aunt say of your intentions?
I do not think she would approve of them.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. She would miss your charming
companionship.”</p>

<p>“It is better, Sarnoff, that you forget me.”</p>

<p>“On account of my aunt?”</p>

<p>“No,” Sana said, rather hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Why, then? For what reason? Do you not
like me a little bit,” he pleaded, peering at her with
anxious eyes.</p>

<p>Sana, shaking her head, responded to the last
question with “Yes, I do. But not enough to marry
you.”</p>

<p>“Then let me teach you how,” he acclaimed
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I can readily believe you to be an excellent
teacher in that respect, but your efforts would be
useless.”</p>

<p>Anxiously, “Are you in love with someone else?
Tell me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I thought your aunt had told you....”</p>

<p>Von Sarnoff interrupted her quickly. “No. I
only know that she does not want me to take you
away as that would mean her loss of you, dearest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>He pressed his lips to her hand, murmuring,
“Dearest, dearest.”</p>

<p>Sana withdrew her hand and attempting to rise,
said, “Come, Sarnoff, it is getting late. You must
go.”</p>

<p>“I will, if you give me hope,” he begged, unsteadily
getting on his feet.</p>

<p>“I shall soon leave this place.” Sana rose from
her chair and turned away.</p>

<p>Von Sarnoff was at her side in an instant, crying
in hurt surprise, “What, Sana, you are going to
leave me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Tomorrow, your aunt and I leave for
Baden-Baden.”</p>

<p>“Positively?”</p>

<p>“Positively!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall see you there later. But now kiss
your ‘little boy’ goodbye.”</p>

<p>Before Sana could realize it, or do anything to
stop him, he held her tight in his arms, madly kissing
her lips, forehead and hair.</p>

<p>Wrenching herself free Sana turned on him, a
dangerous light flashing in her eyes, “I am not accustomed
to that, Count von Sarnoff. I am no
courtesan!”</p>

<p>Swiftly she crossed the room, returning with his
hat and cane, which she tendered to him, with an icy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
“Good night.” Her manner plainly showed her
contempt for his rashness.</p>

<p>Bowing low, von Sarnoff, even then dared kiss her
hand, saying softly “Auf Wiedersehen,” to which
Sana had not the heart to reply.</p>

<p>True to her word, Sana and the Princess Cassandra
left the following morning for Baden-Baden,
Sana noting gladly that von Sarnoff was not at the
station to say “goodbye.”</p>

<p>Arriving at Baden-Baden they engaged rooms at
the Hotel Stephanie, on the right bank of the Oos.
Sana was fairly enchanted by this gorgeous hostelry,
surrounded with its beautiful gardens and directly
opposite the Lichtentaler-Allee. It was a fairyland,
the playground of the wealth of Europe.</p>

<p>Princess Cassandra had many acquaintances there,
and now, accompanied by the charming Sana, she
was more popular than ever. Immediately she and
Sana were in the midst of the social whirl. No dinner
party or other function was complete without
their presence.</p>

<p>A week, the days and nights of which were a continual
round of pleasure, passed before von Sarnoff
put in an appearance. Sana was at dinner among
a group of friends, when he was announced. Joining
the party he proved the gayest of the gay. But
his eyes were constantly upon Sana. He noted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
every word—her every act. He managed that evening
to offer an apology for his rudeness and Sana,
believing him to be sincere, forgave him.</p>

<p>Again she became the target of his amorous attentions.
His determination seemed fired anew.
He catered to her every whim—made a slave of
himself, but pressing his suit all the while.</p>

<p>A few days later, to cap the climax, he gave a
dinner in her honor. It was one of the most exotic
revels ever held at the resort and that is saying a
great deal.</p>

<p>At this private banquet he made violent love to
her. Piqued somewhat at her constant refusal to
entertain his suit, and encouraged, too, by the wine
he had consumed von Sarnoff kneeling at her side,
suddenly reached down, grasped one of Sana’s tiny
feet and quickly removed the jewel encrusted slipper.
Rising to his feet, rather shakily, it is true, he
filled the slipper with champagne, and holding it
aloft in one hand, the other sweeping over the select
assembly, he cried, “To the health of Sana, the
Queen of Queens.” Then amid the cheers of the
diners, he drank from the slipper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="The eager von Sarnoff grasped the shimmering garment">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">The eager von Sarnoff grasped the shimmering garment, buried
his face into its perfumed folds and looked up with eyes of lust
and passion.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Around them a group of professional dancers,
scantily attired, were performing risque solo dances,
but von Sarnoff, sensual though he was, had no eyes
for their display. But like Herod of old begging
Salome to dance, he pleaded with Sana to give them
an exhibition of her dancing art. What tempestuous
thoughts ran through her mind, one cannot tell, but
with a wild laugh and the cry “I will” Sana sprang
up on the table, and kicking off the remaining slipper
sent it flying across the room. Her dinner gown was
too long to allow of much freedom, so with deft
hands she lowered the shoulder straps and cast it off.
The eager Sarnoff grasped the shimmering garment,
buried his face into its perfumed folds, and looking
up with eyes full of lust and passion shouted, “This
is the dance of the virtuous vampire.”</p>

<p>Sana was dancing the dance de Rochelle had
taught her while under his hypnotic influence. Wild
and free! It spoke of desert nights and starry skies;
of whispering winds and silent places. A dance of
beauty. Suddenly she ceased dancing. The fire had
died down. The coaxing, passionate creature was
gone, and in its place stood just a girl.</p>

<p>Springing from the table, she demanded her dress.
With a mocking laugh von Sarnoff sprang aside,
crying “No. I shall keep it always as a souvenir of
passion’s maddest moment.”</p>

<p>With a look of supreme disgust at the laughing
guests, Sana pulled the cloth off an adjoining table,
regardless of the flying dishes and silver, and wrapping
it about her body, fled from the room, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
by von Sarnoff, pouring forth words of endearment
and affection.</p>

<p>Rushing to her rooms, she slammed the door in
his face with a cry that bespoke the agony in her
heart, “Keep away! I hate you!”</p>

<p>That night, counseled by heads wiser than his
own, von Sarnoff left the place.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Among Sana’s various friends at the Stephanie
was Herr Heinecke, a young German engineer.</p>

<p>Heinecke was combining business with pleasure
during his stay at the hotel. He had been sent to
Baden-Baden to supervise an electrical development
in the suburbs of the city, and took advantage of
the opportunity to partake of the baths, the efficacy
of whose waters are known the world over—in fact
the Romans were aware of it, in the days that are
gone, and spoke of the waters as Aquae Aurelias.</p>

<p>But the waters and his work were not the only
things to occupy his thoughts. There was Sana. If
one could question his mind or seek out the innermost
regions of his heart, Sana would loom up high
above even his work. His work could be neglected,
he reasoned with his conscience, but not Sana. She
could not, would not be neglected.</p>

<p>Even though she had already refused his offer of
marriage he was determined to win her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Sana and he were at the Hotel Messmer, one
afternoon, enjoying the music and refreshments,
which were delightful. The hotel was a favored resort
and attracted a large number of noblemen and
people of wealth.</p>

<p>Heinecke had just asked Sana a second time for
her hand when she felt a strange sensation stealing
over her. It was as if some power were seeking to
enter her mind and control her body. Against her
will she turned her head to look behind her. For a
moment she stared in amazement. Her breath came
in gasps. She sank back in her chair as though on
the point of fainting, then finding her voice she
shrieked “de Rochelle!”</p>

<p>It was but too true. There at a table a few steps
away sat de Rochelle, as forbidding as ever. He
had seen her with Heinecke and resorting to the
powers he had exercised of old, he concentrated his
mind upon hers, while staring at the back of her
head, thus drawing her attention to him.</p>

<p>Heinecke, who was somewhat upset by this
strange and unaccountable state of affairs, questioned
Sana as to the cause. As briefly as possible
and in a low trembling tone, Sana answered, “That
man, the fourth table over, is François de Rochelle,
who was once my sweetheart. He possesses a
strange hypnotic influence over me and may cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
me to commit rash acts. Even now I feel his power
and I am afraid.”</p>

<p>Sana’s companion looked over to de Rochelle,
who did not once take his eyes from the girl, although
he was aware that Heinecke was watching
him. This attitude made even the phlegmatic
Heinecke furious. As in the days when he was a
member of a student’s corps, he was ready to fight
a duel at a moment’s notice—the three scars on his
right cheek bore mute testimony to this spirit of
younger days. So calling a waiter he sent his card
to de Rochelle.</p>

<p>Rochelle well knew the intent of that action. He
picked up the card, looked at it and with a sneering
laugh, tore it into bits, tossing the scraps of paste-board
back on the salver, in such a way that there
was no mistaking his meaning.</p>

<p>Heinecke could only stare, muttering to himself,
“No satisfaction to be had. Too bad.”</p>

<p>Sana was eager to get away from de Rochelle,
from the hotel, from everybody, so hurriedly taking
Heinecke by the arm, she fairly dragged him away,
saying, for want of something better, “Now, look at
what you have done!”</p>

<p>From the time that Sana had been carried unconscious
from the morgue, in New York, to the hour
of her departure for Europe Sana had been under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
the constant care of Dr. White and the O’Briens
and they had purposely withheld from her the news
that the body that had been found in the river was
not that of de Rochelle. A newspaper reporter,
who was at the scene of the drowning when the body
was recovered, took it upon himself to say that the
man was de Rochelle. Some cards and papers had
been found on the body bearing the name of “François
de Rochelle,” so it was as a “François de
Rochelle” that the man was buried. As a matter
of fact it developed a few days later that the suicide
was a young bank clerk, who, with de Rochelle, had
speculated heavily with part of the funds raised for
the purpose of carrying out the work of the Sahara
Development Organization. Things had gone
wrong on the market that day and the clerk had
called on de Rochelle, with a view to securing some
money to cover their margins. De Rochelle was not
to be found, but on the table lay a note, addressed
to Sana, in which he stated that he had been discovered
at last. He was going away forever. He
asked her, also, to tell the bank clerk of his leaving.</p>

<p>The clerk, believing at once that de Rochelle was
referring to his shady dealings on the Street, in his
note to Sana, set about to destroy the note upon the
radiator. He had been equally guilty in these money
matters and wanted to hide his trail as much as possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
It was while crossing the Bridge that his
mind, haunted by the fear of possible consequences,
gave way and he took the fatal leap.</p>

<p>Once more had Fate thrown Sana and de Rochelle
together. To the girl it meant grave dangers and
misery. In the silence of her apartment she determined
to leave the place—secretly if necessary.
Slipping quietly down to the lobby of the hotel, she
dispatched a message to her mother, announcing her
intention to come home. Sana realized what she
would have to sacrifice, but nothing counted. She
only wanted to get away, far away from de Rochelle.</p>

<p>The following day, about noon, Sana was crossing
the gardens at the Kurhaus, where hundreds
were promenading and listening to the band. She
had been shopping, purchasing little odds and ends,
among them gifts for her mother.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hand was placed upon her arm.
Frightened she turned to confront de Rochelle. She
tried to evade him, but he only grasped her arm
more tightly so that escape was impossible. In a
low, but not unkindly tone, de Rochelle spoke, asking
her to join him at lunch at the Messmer. Sana
refused and while he was insisting upon her doing
so, aid came in the form of Heinecke.</p>

<p>A few curt words from him placed de Rochelle
on the defensive. An instance later, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Heinecke had taken his glove and struck de Rochelle
across the face. Taking Sana’s arm he
walked off, leaving the furious de Rochelle, whose
face had turned to ashen gray, to cry, “You will
meet me?”</p>

<p>Heinecke turned, drew himself up to full height
and with a stiff bow, retorted, “I am at your
service!”</p>

<p>The next morning, before Heinecke had arisen,
a knock was heard at his door. The seconds of de
Rochelle were announced. They had come to inform
him that de Rochelle was the insulted one
and that he was exercising his privilege of choosing
weapons. He had decided upon pistols, shots to be
exchanged until one or the other fell.</p>

<p>Had Heinecke the option he would have chosen
the sabre of his student days, that being his favorite
weapon. However, he was not afraid. His army
training had taught him the use of a pistol, and in
his heart he was sure that this affair would certainly
win Sana.</p>

<p>Sana, however, on hearing of the coming duel,
sought Heinecke and begged him to desist, saying
“de Rochelle is an expert in the use of a pistol. I
have seen him sever a telephone cord at twenty paces
and hit a plum I had thrown into the air.”</p>

<p>To which entreaties Heinecke replied, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
shrug of his shoulders, “This is an affair of honor.”</p>

<p>The next morning, the two duelists, with their
seconds and a doctor, went to a secluded section of
the Black Forest, about an hour’s ride from the
resort. The day was bright and the cleared spot
in the forest, where blood would flow and probably
a life be sacrificed, had been well chosen by the seconds
the preceding day.</p>

<p>The preliminaries over, the two men took their
stand, facing each other at fifteen paces. Pistols
were leveled. They awaited the word to fire—Heinecke
cool and determined, de Rochelle perhaps
equally determined but rather shaky, having spent
the previous evening drinking champagne in celebration
of the coming duel.</p>

<p>Sana was up before daybreak that morning.
When Heinecke left, she followed in an automobile,
at a distance, so as not to arouse suspicion. At a
road crossing she had lost track of Heinecke’s car,
but shortly afterward discovered it, and another,
parked by the roadside. She ordered the chauffeur
to stop the car, jumping from it before it had come
to a standstill.</p>

<p>As she did so, she heard two shots ring out simultaneously,
echoing and re-echoing through the silent
forest. In feverish haste she ran in the direction
from whence the sound had come. Another deafening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
report vibrated the morning air. Turning aside,
Sana came upon the clearing. The two combatants
still held their ground, while the seconds were reloading
the pistols. The weapons again in their
hands, Heinecke and de Rochelle renewed the combat.
As they leveled the pistols, Sana wanted to cry
out, but running forward blindly, stumbled and fell.
As she arose, she heard the word “Three” and looking
up saw the flash of the shots. To her horror,
she saw one of the men, she could not tell which,
waver and sink helpless to the earth.</p>

<p>“Oh, God!” The words came in a quivering cry.
Because of her, a woman, a man had just fallen
wounded, perhaps dead.</p>

<p>At the cry a man stepped forward. It was
Heinecke. He pointed in the direction of de Rochelle,
who, badly wounded in the right shoulder, was
being attended by the doctor.</p>

<p>Sana looked at the fallen man. Then came reaction.
With a withering look of scorn, and unmindful
of Heinecke’s outstretched hand, she upbraided
him, “Shame unto you! You have soiled
your hands and stained your soul with the blood of
a creature not worthy of the bullet you fired into
him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">At her cry he stepped forward, pointing in the direction of de

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Heinecke looked at the girl in a strange, curious
way, then looking toward de Rochelle, he spoke in
a low and somewhat sad tone, “If it had not been
for his coming, you might have been mine by this
time. I feel like putting this man out of your way
and life forever. Leave me—for a while at least.”</p>

<p>Sana, realizing his desire, did not move, but whispered
beseechingly, “Heinecke, I implore you, stop!
I do not love you, so why risk your life for me?
Consider, please.”</p>

<p>Her plea was in vain. Heinecke, changing his
tone of voice and manner, commanded her to leave.
Upon her refusing to do so, he attempted to gently
lead her away, when the mocking voice of de Rochelle
reached them. He had gotten to his feet.</p>

<p>“Here! Herr Heinecke!” The words came
with a sneer. “You shall not hide behind a woman’s
skirts. Stand your ground, you coward!”</p>

<p>With this he grasped the pistol his second had
reloaded and aimed it at Heinecke.</p>

<p>His sneering laugh chilled Sana’s blood as he continued,
“Come back. I will kill you like a dog in this
woman’s presence.”</p>

<p>Heinecke, with a shrug of the shoulders, awaited
the shot.</p>

<p>De Rochelle had barely time to pull the trigger
when the gun was wrested from his hand. Two
men had jumped from the brush behind him and
were now holding him a prisoner. De Rochelle demanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
an explanation of what he termed “an outrage,”
was politely informed that he was under arrest
and was shown a warrant as their authority.</p>

<p>The sight of this caused Sana to give a sigh of
relief. Her plan had worked!</p>

<p>After Heinecke had told her of the proposed duel,
Sana finding her pleas of no avail, sought to prevent
the combat in another manner. She, of course, had
been informed on her return to Paris of the manner
in which de Rochelle had run the affairs of the company
he represented in New York. She knew, too,
just how much of the company’s money he had appropriated
for his own uses. So with this knowledge
in mind she went to one of those detective
agencies, to be found the world over, where “hard
cash” is a means to an end and placed her proposition
before them. Yes, it could be done! They
would do anything for a consideration.</p>

<p>Accordingly two of the firm’s hirelings trailed de
Rochelle that morning, armed with a fake warrant
calling for his arrest and extradition to France, to
answer charges of embezzlement. They had arrived
on the scene a little late, but, nevertheless, in
time.</p>

<p>Turning to Sana, de Rochelle addressed her, with
supreme sarcasm, “You have done a noble thing.
Noble indeed! To save your lover you have betrayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
me. But wait. My love for you has gone.
Insatiable hate has taken its place. As I have
adored you in the past, so do I despise you now!
I shall be free again, and I assure you, by God, that
the day shall come when you will lie before me prostrate
and pleading. And all your pleading shall be
in vain!”</p>

<p>Raising his voice until it fairly shrieked at them
he added, “You shall go down with me! It may
take time, but I shall get even with you!”</p>

<p>Heinecke was about to spring forward, but Sana
restrained him with “Please don’t.”</p>

<p>To which Heinecke replied, his lips twitching with
scorn, “I’m sorry I couldn’t finish the job.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That evening, leaving notes for her friends, the
Princess Cassandra and Heinecke, Sana secretly left
the gay watering-place to go home.</p>

THE GREAT DESERT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE plan for flooding the Sahara, as fostered
by the French Government, attracted widespread
attention. Even in America, accustomed
as it is to great engineering undertakings, the
plan created a great deal of interest, much of it
critical.</p>

<p>Among the Americans to challenge the proposed
work was Carl Lohman, a New York engineer and
writer of international reputation. Lohman counted
among his friends the foremost editors, men whose
fearless pens are watched the world over by financiers
and politicians. The pages of the daily press
were open to him and in them he attacked the plan.</p>

<p>So thorough was he in his attacks and criticisms
that the French authorities invited him to submit alternative
plans. To this end, Lohman left for the
Sahara on an inspection tour, arriving at the Gulf
of Gabes, on the Mediterranean Sea, where the
canal was to be built.</p>

<p>Here he met the pilot who was to lead him over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the desert to study the territory at close range.
After studying the canal site, on horseback, for a
few days, they boarded an aeroplane, which was
well provisioned, and soon they were flying over vast
stretches of sand. They made wide detours, in their
flight, so as to get a more general view of the situation.
Finally they turned southward to reach Timbuktoo
on the Niger river.</p>

<p>Two nights were spent on well selected ground.
On the third day they came to the Queen City of the
Sahara, Timbuktoo, where they intended replenishing
their gasoline supply, and thus be able to return
to the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>During the entire flight Carl was busy making copious
notes to be used in connection with his plans
on his return to America.</p>

<p>Carl was proud of his mission. And rightly so.
The son of a New York banker, with the advantages
of a family name and all that wealth could
buy, he had spurned them, rising in his profession
solely by his own ability and perseverance.</p>

<p>His college days over, Carl had gone to San Francisco.
Here he secured employment with an engineering
concern engaged in extensive hydraulic and
land irrigating developments. A few years of this
work and he returned to New York, where he joined
an efficiency engineering firm. Here, too, he showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
his ability. By his methods of handling material in
various manufacturing plants much money was saved
and with greater efficiency. Electric stations, he
proved, could be operated at less cost, while in the
field of street lighting, several cities benefited by his
knowledge, securing better light and at a great saving
to the municipality and the electric power
companies.</p>

<p>Carl recognized as his greatest asset the teachings
of his parents. From childhood he had been taught
by them the virtue of “Economy and Efficiency.”
It had been their watchword through life and he was
determined that it should be his. Not alone to himself
but to those who came to him for advice did he
preach this doctrine.</p>

<p>His books and numerous scientific publications,
too, brought home to the reader the value of those
two words. Before establishing himself in a business
of his own, he widened his field of activity, going
to the Charlottenburg University to study city
planning and its kindred subject, municipal engineering.
Charlottenburg was the only college teaching
these subjects, although German cities, for the past
two generations, have been practicing the art in connection
with municipal improvements.</p>

<p>His studies took him on extensive trips over Europe
to study the art of the great masters Sitte,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Stuebben, Baumeister, Hausmann and others. He
visited the medieval cities of Nuremberg, Rothenburg,
Regensburg and others, all of which showed
that the Romans, who laid the original foundations
of these cities, had certain definite knowledge of city
planning. However, these early city planners did
not impart their theory but left only their accomplishments
as a record of their work. It remained
for the Germans to place the art of city planning on
a scientific basis, and realizing the great benefits derived,
other countries fell into line, following the
system established by the Germans.</p>

<p>During his travels Carl did not fail to visit the
ancient Roman and Greek cities, where the remains
of once great structures and roadways testify to the
skill of the city builders.</p>

<p>While L’Enfant, who planned the city of Washington,
admittedly the most beautiful city of America
and one of the finest in the world, enjoyed the
double good fortune of having the support of the
founders of the Republic and an unencumbered site
upon which to build, the problem in most cases today
is to replace existing cities and provide for future
developments.</p>

<p>Upon his return to America, Carl located in New
York, opening an office as consulting engineer and
advisory city planner. He applied his knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to getting “hard cash,” but he very often worked
for little or no compensation. It did not matter to
him—all he wanted to see was the ultimate result.</p>

<p>His reputation as a successful engineer and writer
became widespread, with the result that he was besieged
from all sides with requests to engage in industrial
campaigns and the like. Quite a number of
concerns owe to him and his writings the fact that
they got out of the rut and were able to re-establish
themselves on a sound financial basis.</p>

<p>To him, also, came concerns with shady reputations
in the hope that he would lend the weight of
his name to their prospectuses. But they were politely
requested to seek such assistance elsewhere.</p>

<p>But city planning was his forte. It appealed to
him as did no other work. He recognized the
great opportunity for the replanning of American
cities, so long neglected with such costly results as
are seen in the unnecessary congestion and crowded
conditions of some portions and the backward development
of others—in the slums on one hand
and the inaccessible suburbs on the others—so characteristic
of the majority of our cities.</p>

<p>The citizens of a small town never imagine that
it will become a large city. They may, at times,
dream of it as spreading out around the nucleus in
which they live and they may frequently boast of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
progress their town has made in the previous decade,
but the day that will see their town a great city
seems so far distant that, as a rule, they do not
imagine it will ever occur.</p>

<p>Time slips quickly by and the sites for great improvements,
which might have been laid out and reserved
for convenient plans, that only need to be
committed to paper, become impossible save at enormous
and prohibitive expense. It thus happens that
many cities, expanded over ground that once was
made up of farms, have street plans originally determined
by the fancy of the home-wandering cow
and her calf. But great volumes of traffic must inevitably
follow the path marked out by these dumb
animals, unless costly changes be made.</p>

<p>Carl was aware of the great importance, to cities
large and small, of having plans prepared by experts
to serve as a guide for the gradual development of
the city on a scientific basis.</p>

<p>Since engaging in such work, Carl had received
many contracts for planning new towns and remodeling
old cities. Besides he did considerable work
along electrical lines. His spare time was occupied
in writing books and contributing articles on city
planning, industrial efficiency and national economy,
to various newspapers and magazines. Carl was
recognized as a man of great versatility. His prestige<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
as an authority in his profession rose rapidly
and his absorbing interest in his work caused many
complaints from old acquaintances who still felt the
lure of Broadway.</p>

<p>With a sudden jar he was shaken out of his mental
dream as to his own importance. The aeroplane,
in landing at the outskirts of Timbuktoo, struck a
sand dune and was damaged considerably, and its
occupants badly shaken up, although not seriously
injured.</p>

<p>They climbed from their seats and while the pilot
looked after his aeroplane, Carl stood on the fringe
of the Great Desert, wondering how he would solve
that vast problem of so world-wide a character. He
felt the importance of his mission. The realization
came to him that his work would have a unique influence
on the world. Its welfare he held in his
hand.</p>

<p>He had done important work before. But now!
Alone he could move the world—change the great
laws of nature! He could create a new land or destroy
an old one. He could do this—he—Carl
Lohman! Was it to be wondered that his bosom
heaved with emotion as he gazed out over the endless
barren wastes, which, at his command, could be
made to blossom with the fullness of the Earth’s
fruits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>How true, he thought, the saying “Knowledge is
Power.” That phrase answered the questions in his
mind. Yes, his knowledge would bring it about.</p>

<p>A mental picture came to him, like a fata morgana,
a mirage of the desert, reflected high in the
heavens. A picture of the day to come.</p>

<p>This picture, however, came to an abrupt end.
The pilot, who had been endeavoring to repair the
damaged aeroplane, had come up to Carl, saying,
“The damage to the engine is too great to be repaired
here. What are we going to do now?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of that. I think we should
go by camel to the north and have some fun.”</p>

<p>The other smiled “Fun? Fun you will get all right
if you should ever fall into the hands of the bandit
tribes that infest the sands. I know them. During
the war I was handled rather roughly by them in
France, although I was no enemy of theirs. They
had been forced into the fight and they wanted to
be savage. And they knew how. You talk about
the Turk. He was nothing compared to them. At
least the Turk was fighting for his country—these
just fought for the sake of killing. They would
have put an end to me, had not help come in time.”</p>

<p>“All right! We can talk matters over tomorrow.
Let’s find a hotel, if there is one, where we can get
a bite to eat. I’m starving.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>The pilot rejoined, “All right, so am I.”</p>

<p>The aeroplane had landed but a short distance
from the city and it had already attracted a host of
bewildered people. They had never seen an aeroplane
before, so on they came, old and young, black
and white, to examine the strange monster from the
sky. No less strange to them appeared the two men
who had come with it. In language unknown to
Carl, they pointed from the machine to the men,
showing plainly their awe and fear.</p>

<p>A French army officer came up to Carl and questioned
him as to the accident, but Carl could only
refer him to the pilot, who had returned to the
wrecked machine, the motley mob scattering to all
sides at his approach.</p>

<p>After the pilot had secured all that was likely to
fall prey to the thieving fingers of the crowd—the
Arabs and their kin are born thieves—he and Carl
set out for the hotel to which the officer had directed
them.</p>

<p>As they approached the hotel, the proprietor, a
shifty-looking Arabian-Jew, stepped out to greet
them with a great show of welcome and a greater
anticipation of gain.</p>

<p>Carl had learned from his pilot that caravans left
very seldom and at irregular intervals for the north,
because of the unexplored conditions of the desert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
and of the still greater danger of being beset by the
roaming bands of bandits, who ever lay in wait for
caravans of merchants.</p>

<p>He came to the conclusion, therefore, after studying
his maps, that he had best secure an automobile
to take him to Bammurka, from which point he
could take the railroad to St. Louis or Dakar on the
Atlantic coast. From there he could get passage to
New York, while his pilot could easily return by
water to Algeria. This meant a tedious journey of
some five hundred miles, by automobile, down the
Niger and Joliba rivers, but it appeared the most
feasible plan.</p>

<p>He questioned the hotel keeper as to the prospects
of securing an automobile and to his regret
was told that such a thing was out of the question.
There were a few automobiles to be sure, but there
was not enough gasoline in Timbuktoo at that time
to last half the trip. In fact every one of the machines
was useless because of this scarcity of fuel.
Carl recalled, too, that they had been forced to land
the aeroplane because the gasoline supply was getting
low.</p>

<p>“Why not go by caravan?” he was asked.</p>

<p>“Caravan? When?” Carl questioned. This was
more to his liking.</p>

<p>“Three days from now. Thursday morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Yesterday a tourist party came in. They had made
arrangements months ago for a special caravan
from here to Mogador. You can join them. It
could easily be arranged.”</p>

<p>Carl voiced his thanks with a bit of silver.</p>

<p>The Jew added, “They will be here tonight at
seven. I will tell them you wish to meet them. By
the way,” his eyes glinting craftily, “there will be an
entertainment tonight for these travelers. Do not
miss it. It will be worth your while.”</p>

<p>Arrangements to join the caravan were easily
made. The tourists, after hearing his story, readily
consented to his request to be allowed to accompany
them. In fact they wanted him to come. He
had seen the desert from aeroplane and could tell
them more about it than even the guides.</p>

<p>After a short chat, during which the success of the
journey was toasted by Carl, he excused himself and
went to his room to write the following report to
the New York newspapers.</p>

<p>“I find that there are no great difficulties to be
encountered in building the canal, which has to be
about fifty miles long. The waters of the sea, coming
through this canal would flood an immense area,
forming a great inland sea. The canal could be
made sufficiently large to permit the passage of
ocean steamers through it into the inland waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“While there is a possibility of the canal being
silted up with dune sand, it is estimated that it would
take from 1,000 to 1,500 years for this to occur.</p>

<p>“The cost of the canal would be at least $100,000,000,
and it would take five years or longer to
build it. Laborers could be drawn from the interior
tribes, such as Senegals, Moroccans, Algerians
and Turcoes.</p>

<p>“The Gulf of Gabes is separated by a ridge some
forty feet across and perhaps one hundred and fifty
feet high, from Shat-al Fejej, a depression which
runs southwest into the Shat Jerid, which, in turn,
is separated from the Shat Garsa only by a still narrower
ridge. Shat Garsa is succeeded westward by
a series of smaller depressions and beyond them lies
the Shat Melrir, whose northwestern extremity is
not far from the town of Biskra, a favorite winter
resort of North Africa.</p>

<p>“The original author of this scheme to flood the
Sahara was Colonel François Roudaire, who proposed
it some fifty years ago to the French Government.
Roudaire’s plan was strongly advocated between
1870 and 1885, receiving support from Ferdinand
de Lesseps, the French builder of the Suez
Canal, now controlled by the English, who acquired
it through crafty diplomacy. That plan fell through,
because of the adverse criticism and it will fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
through once more. While it would have a certain
great result for France, the consequences due to the
change of climate would not only affect Africa, but
would be disastrous to the entire world.</p>

<p>“After having inspected the site of the proposed
canal I have been piloted by a French aviator over
the mysterious deserts. Contrary to my own and
most people’s ideas, I found to my delight, that the
desert is not all sand.</p>

<p>“The story my father once told me, when I was
a small boy, came to my mind. He said that the
easiest way to catch the lions of Africa was to sift
the sands of the deserts, and what did not go
through the mesh of the sieve were the lions.</p>

<p>“We flew over depressions and mountains, ranging
from 100 feet below sea level to 6,000 feet
above. In isolated instances, the mountains rose up
to a height of 8,000 feet or more. A few of the
mountains were of volcanic origin as could be seen
from the craters and cones.</p>

<p>“It is said that some of these mountainous regions,
never actually explored, are the dwelling
places of the descendants of pre-historic cave men.
Whether this is true or not I cannot say. I kept a
sharp lookout for them, but did not succeed in seeing
them.</p>

<p>“We passed over valleys through which, at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
time, water must have flowed. Vast tracts of loose
stones and pebbles were to be seen, their surfaces
highly polished by the sand winds passing over them.</p>

<p>“On every hand there was sand. Sand and more
sand. The sand dunes seemed to be without end.
These dunes, or sand waves, for that is what they
really are, vary in length and height and run diagonally
to the prevailing winds. Shifting under the
force of the wind, they travel slowly in different directions,
filling old depressions and leaving new ones
in their wake. Oases have been literally swallowed
up by these sand waves, which, in their irresistible
march, passed over them and on, leaving no trace
of what was previously a garden spot in the desert.</p>

<p>“Most curious are the inland mountains, known
as the ‘Witness of the Arabs.’ These are the remains
of a one-time widely distributed mountain terrace.
The sand winds and storms passing over them
through the years have robbed them of most of their
bulk, leaving only the solid hard cores, which now
form a group of flat-topped pyramidal mountains.</p>

<p>“While flying over these mountains, a band of
savages began shooting at us. They had become
frightened at our aeroplane. Luckily we were high
enough to be beyond range of their rifles and no
damage resulted.</p>

<p>“A great many oases were to be seen. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
cover great areas, while here and there are smaller
ones. Some of the smaller ones are grouped
together.</p>

<p>“Most of these oases are rich in vegetation, especially
in fruits, such as apples, peaches, oranges,
citrons, figs, grapes and pomegranates. The date,
however, predominates. The oases are the home
of the date palm and these trees play a most important
part in desert life. Staple foods, such as corn,
wheat, rice, barley, durra and dukhn, are also
grown. Besides these a few other tropical products
are cultivated.</p>

<p>“Asses, camels and a breed of black cattle are the
main domestic animals. Of course the full-blooded
horse is to be seen in large numbers.</p>

<p>“The population, made up of Berbers, Arabs,
Maurers, Negroes and Jews, is chiefly engaged
in cattle raising and trading. The caravans, in their
journey across the desert, pass through various oases
at which they replenish supplies. It is at these oases
that trading is liveliest. For products of the oases
are traded guns, ammunition, gold dust, clothing and
quite often slaves brought with the caravans from
the seacoast cities.</p>

<p>“France also contemplates building railways
through the Sahara to furnish easy communication
between Algeria and Nigeria. This proposed plan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
has already found many advocates. Two principal
railroad routes have been suggested: one taking the
easterly line from Biskra through Wargla to Air
and Zinder—the route followed by Fourneau in
1898, under the protection of Major Laury; the
other starting from the terminus of the most westerly
railway already existing at the Harbor of Casablanca,
and reaching Timbuktoo by way of Igli and
the Tuat Oasis. But these plans are dreams. At
any rate the railways themselves are a long way
off, as they would not earn interest on the capital
invested.</p>

<p>“For a long time to come travel across the Sahara
will be by caravan. There are five principal north
and south caravan routes. One from Rio de Oro
leads over the Waran Desert to Timbuktoo on the
Niger River; one from Mogador, in Morocco, goes
through the sand-hill region of Igidi to Timbuktoo;
another from Tangiers and Algiers through the
Tuat Oasis to Timbuktoo; another from Tripolis,
over Ghadames and Ghat at the Tasili Mountains
to Kano and still another from Tripolis over the
Oasis Blima to Kuke, at the Tsad Sea, and then on
to Bengasi and Wadai. The foremost are those
leading to Timbuktoo, the Queen City of the Sahara.</p>

<p>“Long before Christ, some of the present routes
were used by the Romans in their explorations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
desert for its products. In the fourth century, Field-Marshal
Salomon penetrated from the north to Timbuktoo
and as far as the Sudan. Missionaries,
preaching the doctrines of Mohammed and Islam,
in crossing the desert, used the same routes as are
used today. For centuries, so far, there has been
nothing new under the sun of the Great Desert, with
probably the exception of the Frenchman Lebaudy’s
adventure in 1913, attempting to crown himself
‘Emperor of the Sahara.’</p>

<p>“Progress is not made here as in other countries
and as a result this vast land is the least populated
of any on the face of the earth. While the climate
is not what might be termed unhealthful, the climatic
conditions of the desert are, however, the cause of
the stagnation. The temperature ranges from
seventy to one hundred and twenty degrees, Fahrenheit,
during the day time, while the nights are cold
with a temperature of thirty-five to forty-five and
quite often below zero.</p>

<p>“Very little rain falls, and the desert rarely experiences
a rain storm. However, frequent and terrific
electrical discharges take place and the desert
dweller is ever in fear of the terrible blizzard-like
sand storms.</p>

<p>“But for all that, the Sahara has played her part
in history. In the days of Julius Caesar and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
later Roman emperors, the Sahara was called the
‘Granary of the Roman Empire.’ Rome, then at
the pinnacle of power, took the wealth of the desert.
Slaves were carried to Rome together with vast
quantities of grain, oil, wine, leather, spices and perfumes.
Served and fed at little or no cost by the
subject colonies of North Africa, the Romans were
enabled to lead a life of the maddest luxury, idleness
and self indulgence.</p>

<p>“While landing near Timbuktoo yesterday, the
pilot drove the nose of the plane into the sand,
wrecking the machine. Neither of us was hurt.
Will stay here for a few days’ rest, and will then
take the first opportunity to return to America.”</p>

<p>The article finished, Carl posted it immediately.
He went out to smoke a cigarette and later, for want
of something better to do, sauntered over to the
dance-hall designated by the hotel keeper that afternoon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

THE DANCE OF THE VAMPIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE dancing place, an open space surrounded
by palms and date trees, under which
were tables and chairs for the guests, was
already quite crowded when Carl arrived. As he
looked about for a seat, an Arab, apparently acting
as an usher to the Europeans, guided him through
the crowd to a seat near the arena. What mattered
it if the seat were already occupied by another Arab?
A few words and the threat of a kick sent him
scurrying away, although Carl noted, with a smile,
that he waited nearby for the other, apparently in
anticipation of part of Carl’s tip.</p>

<p>A native tribe was performing one of their wild
desert dances, swinging their guns and great scimitar-like
knives in a most fascinating way—howling
and shrieking at the top of their lungs and accompanied
by the deafening noise of a native band.</p>

<p>The dance over, there was a wild scrambling
among the dancers to get the coins that were tossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to them by the spectators. The last coin tossed and
picked up; the last dancer aided from the scene by a
prod of a booted foot, a man stepped into the circle
and in a loud voice proclaimed,</p>

<p>“You are now going to witness the ‘Dance of the
Vampire’ by the Europeanized Desert Flower.
This young siren has been proclaimed by the art
judges of Europe to be one of the most lovely
women on earth. Her beauty is beyond words and
her dance extraordinary! But judge for yourself!
Behold Sana, our Desert Flower. None can rival
her. Not even the beauties of the harem!”</p>

<p>Musing to himself, Carl muttered, “If I were not
in Africa I should swear I was at Coney Island.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the audience are turned toward a tent
near the dancing space. There is a low rumble from
the tom-toms of the native orchestra. The flaps of
the tent are pushed aside and a young woman steps
out. For a moment she stands there, looking over
the crowd as if in defiance. Then with a graceful
movement of her arms she casts aside the native
shawl in which she is wrapped.</p>

<p>The spectators stir in their chairs. From all sides
come the “ahs” of expectant watchers. Carl, too,
is visibly affected. The “barker” was right. The
woman, whoever she was, could take a beauty prize
anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>The music grows louder while the dancer with
fleet steps, hurries to the middle of the arena to
commence her dance.</p>

<p>Carl notes her costume. About her brow is bound
a strand of flashing gems. Her body is bare, covered
only by a pair of violet colored breast shields,
richly embroidered with a bluebird design of beads;
short satin tights, slashed at the sides, and also of
violet hue. These are augmented by a string of
pearls, hanging from her neck holding the breast
shield in place. Yet there was nothing indelicate
about this scanty costume. Carl recalled that he had
seen many in France that were shocking when compared
to this. Here was beauty and harmony. It
was not the costume but the girl whose beauties it
revealed that made it a wonderful picture.</p>

<p>There were dangerous curves ahead, Carl mused,
for those of the men in the audience who were so
inclined. The women, he felt sure, would appear to
be unaware of her beauties, but would, nevertheless,
make comparisons in their own minds.</p>

<p>To Carl, however, no sensual thoughts occurred.
To him the girl was an object of art. With a connoisseur’s
eye for beauty he studied her from head
to foot. Her height he judged to be about five feet
five inches; her figure that of Venus de Medici. Having
a good memory for figures he recalled that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
dimensions of that statue were, bust and hips, 36
and 38 inches respectively; waist, 26 inches. The
dancer’s back was long and slender, almost flat near
the shoulders, but deeply curved at the waist. Her
limbs were well rounded, soft and large at the hips,
tapering down very gently toward small dimpled
knees. From there they gracefully swelled to her
calves and in exquisite proportion diminished gently
to her finely rounded ankles and slender feet. Her
smooth arms were softly molded from shoulder to
wrist, with dimpled elbows like a baby’s. The
small wrists with long slender hands and fingers
were those of an aristocrat. Her entire body, he
noted, scarcely revealed the existence of bone—in
fact there were no sharp, thin or angular points to
be seen. Indeed a veritable Venus!</p>

<p>Her soft skin, of fine texture, was uniformly
tanned over her entire body, as if she were wont to
take regular sun baths in Eve’s costume. Powder
and rouge were conspicuous by their absence, her
complexion being naturally healthy and full of
bloom. A beautiful symmetrical face, with a delicate
lower jaw, a small, distinctly curved, cupid’s
bow mouth; a high finely arched brow added to the
beauty of her sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>Hers was a gracefully molded head, somewhat
high forehead, with a straight, clear cut, slender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
nose, indicating intelligence. Her dark hair and silk-like
skin showed her refinement of birth; her intelligent
eyes, gray-blue, were lustrous and brilliant, full
of fire, and in size well proportioned to her ruby-lipped
mouth. When smiling, slightly pinkish teeth,
semi-transparent, looking like two rows of pearls,
enchanted the beholder.</p>

<p>Her upward curved oval shaped nostrils, and the
small wrists and ankles, together with her entire bearing,
betrayed that she was, or at least could be, a
woman of extreme passion. She could be a vampire,
Carl mused, a real one, if once her nature was
aroused.</p>

<p>He could not tell whether desire had as yet been
awakened in her. Young and vibrant, she appeared,
off hand, as a rare desert flower, grown up undefiled
and now blooming in full glory.</p>

<p>Then came reaction. Carl felt himself consumed
by an overpowering desire for this girl. To make
matters worse, the dancer when passing his table,
gave him a glance that caused his bosom to heave
and his eyes to shine with that light that clever
women kindle in men.</p>

<p>To his mind came memories of the many girls he
had met and known. None of them, he realized,
would ever mean anything to him now. This desert
dancer was his ideal. Yes, Grace, Fannie, Marion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and the rest were out of the question now. None of
them could compare with this girl, either in physical
or spiritual beauty. Dorinda was about the only
girl whose figure could match that of this dancer.</p>

<p>But Carl was not alone in his studies of the girl.
The others, too, are gazing intently at her. Not a
movement of her lithe form escaped their eager
eyes. Not a sound came from their lips, even their
breathing seemed suppressed. It was as quiet as
Mass at church.</p>

<p>Carl could scarcely restrain himself when the dancer
came near him, whirling and gyrating her body.
And the dance! Carl had never seen anything of
its kind before. This was no shimmy of the city
dance-hall, no “danse du ventre,” but something wild
and free. Wild and free, he reasoned, like the girl
herself.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and in her look Carl thought he
read mutual understanding. The girl seemed to lose
control of herself. Carl feared what would come
next, when suddenly the music stopped its wail. The
dancer stopped and bowing to the audience sought
to return to her tent amidst the applause of the
crowd.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Carl was all fire and flame as he pondered in his
mind on how he could best become acquainted with
her. One of his first thoughts was, “If she were only
on Broadway, instead of here in the wilderness, surrounded
by date trees and sand, monkeys and lions.”</p>

<p>He raised his glass to his lips, when he heard a
slight uproar in the vicinity of the dancer’s tent.
Looking closely he saw that one of the visitors, more
intoxicated by the liquor he had consumed than by
the beauty of the dancer, was endeavoring to embrace
and kiss her.</p>

<p>It was but a matter of a moment for Carl to
reach the spot. Angrily he pulled the man aside.
This started a fight. The annoyer attempted to pummel
Carl, who proceeded to take all the fight out of
him with a straight left to the jaw. With a thud
the other hit the ground, but quickly recovered himself
and sneaked shamefaced and properly chagrined
from the place.</p>

<p>The hour was late and most of the people soon
left the dancing place. The tourists disappeared,
and the place became practically deserted save for
a few natives.</p>

<p>The dancer came up close to Carl, and, much to
his surprise, thanked him in excellent English. He
mumbled something as to its “being all right”; but
before he realized what he was saying he had asked
whether he could speak to her a while.</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation her consent was
given. As he sat opposite the girl he studied her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
face intently. Was he dreaming? Or did he really
recall those eyes? A new feeling, far different from
that which he experienced when she danced before
him, came to Carl, supplanting that less worthy one.</p>

<p>The girl, seeing Carl’s hesitancy to speak, began,
“I feel as if I must tell you the whole story—that is,
if you care to hear.”</p>

<p>“Please do,” returned Carl. During the dance he
knew of many things he would like to say to her, but
now—well he thought it best to let her do the talking.</p>

<p>“Well, to get to the point, the man you just drove
away has long been an evil influence in my life. His
name is de Rochelle. I worked for him as his secretary
in Paris and New York. He forced his love
upon me, through hypnotic influence. Later, he
wanted to get rid of me, so, while he had me under
his influence he commanded me to commit suicide
by leaping from one of the bridges that span the
East River, in New York.”</p>

<p>“Commit suicide?” questioned the astounded
Carl. “But why should he command that?”</p>

<p>“I found out, later, that he would have collected
some fifty thousand dollars’ insurance and would
have returned to France to marry another girl.”</p>

<p>“The beast,” was all Carl could say.</p>

<p>The girl continued, “I would have carried out his
orders but for an incident I have never forgotten.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
As I was about to swing myself over the rail, a gentleman
came up to hand me a handkerchief I had
dropped in my excitement. He kept talking to me,
not realizing, I suppose, my true intentions.”</p>

<p>Carl, his mouth half-opened in astonishment and
looking at her as if dazed, reached across the table
to clasp her hand, when she said, “I believe it was
you who saved my life.”</p>

<p>Silently they gazed at each other, the tears coming
to their eyes. The girl had difficulty to keep
from crying aloud, while Carl, deeply moved, could
find no word to relieve the situation. Words are
helpless things at times and at best they fail to
convey our true feelings. Volumes were spoken in
silence by the look in their eyes and the pressure
of Carl’s hand.</p>

<p>The girl’s hands trembled in his clasp, although
he felt a slight pressure of them on his own. He
drew one hand away to reach for a handkerchief so
that she might dry her eyes. For a moment the
gaze of the few people still present, caused him embarrassment.
What he would have liked to have
done was to take her in his arms, to console her and
kiss the tears away.</p>

<p>Steeling herself against the emotion which was
striving to get the better of her, Sana dried her eyes
and attempted to smile. It was like the first sunbeam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
that shoots from out the rifts of the departing
storm clouds. It served to restore the equilibrium
which had been so sorely disturbed by the emotional
interlude.</p>

<p>It was difficult for them to continue the conversation
on this subject, so they had some refreshments,
talking the while of everything and nothing. It was
the most natural thing for the conversation to drift
back to New York, and drift there it did.</p>

<p>They spoke of many things of mutual interest.
Carl told her of his work at home, of his books, and
why he visited the Sahara. Still puzzled though as
to why Sana should be here in the desert, he asked
her the reason.</p>

<p>“That, too, is part of my story. But I shall begin
at a point before I was born.</p>

<p>“As a youth, Baron von Seckt was the ‘black
sheep’ of a family of the German nobility. He was
what you Americans call a good sport, squandering
his parents’ money and contracting debts. Naturally
he was much mixed up in social affairs and was the
cause of many a family ‘row.’</p>

<p>“At last his escapades became too much for his
father, who decided that the son would have to go
either to America or Africa. The young man selected
the latter.</p>

<p>“He had money enough to last him perhaps a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
year. He would enjoy himself while the money
lasted—after that he could go to work. With this
in mind he joined a hunting party. While in the
region of the Niger River, near Ansozo, he became
separated from his friends. He wandered around,
lost and finally, totally exhausted, lay down to
sleep. In his sleep he was attacked by a giant tiger
snake. During the struggle which followed he was
badly bitten by the snake. He managed, however,
to kill it with his knife, and after freeing himself
from its coils, fired several shots into its body to
make sure it was dead.</p>

<p>“These shots attracted the attention of a hunter
who at the time was not far away. He found the
stricken man, by then unconscious and took him to
his camp, where he was taken care of by the hunter’s
wife, a young and full-blooded gypsy.</p>

<p>“Blood poisoning set in and the Baron was confined
to his bed for some time. During this time
the gypsy nursed and cared for the sick man, probably
with more ardor than was necessary. The result
was obvious. One day, even before the Baron
was quite recovered, the hunter discovered him and
the woman in very compromising circumstances.
He pulled his revolver to make an end to the unfaithful
pair, but he was not quick enough. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Baron rushed at him and in the struggle that followed
the hunter accidentally killed himself.</p>

<p>“Shortly afterward the Baron married the gypsy,
who as time passed gave birth to me, daughter of the
Baron. That was at Temmimun, on the Gurara
Oasis, where the couple had settled shortly prior to
my birth. I am thus a ‘child of love.’</p>

<p>“My father taught me German, French and English,
while my mother taught me to play the violin,
at which she was an adept. When I became sixteen
my father took me to England to study, and probably
to find a life companion. English life and its
hypocrisy did not appeal to me, so shortly afterward
I went to Paris, making my home with a family I
had met in London. Then I learned that my father
had suddenly died of heart failure and that I would
be forced to make my own way through life.</p>

<p>“My knowledge of languages enabled me to secure
work with an engineering concern, contemplating
developments in the Sahara desert. This is the
organization of which you spoke.</p>

<p>“Among the promoters of this concern was de
Rochelle and soon he became one of my most ardent
admirers. Although I was by no means in love with
him, I often went to dinner or to the theater with
him. One evening after dinner, which was served
in a private dining-room, he spoke to me of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
hypnotic powers. I had once read a book on the
subject and was interested. In a joking way he offered
to show me how it worked. Before I knew it,
or could say a word in objection, I was under his
influence. Months afterward I discovered that that
night he had commanded me to love him and to
marry him.</p>

<p>“From that night on it seemed that I took a great
and unaccountable liking for the man. Previously
I had merely endured him. Now I loved him and
was his willing slave. Before long we were engaged
to be married. At times, though, the feeling of repulsion
returned, but under his influence this soon
gave way, disappearing finally for good.</p>

<p>“De Rochelle’s work was to raise the money for
the Sahara Development Organization, and to that
end he was sent to New York. He induced me to
accompany him as his secretary. What followed is
already known to you.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the scheme of flooding the
Sahara?” Carl asked, fearing a further discussion of
her troubles might renew her tears.</p>

<p>“I do not like it. I fear it.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“The plan is to make the desert fertile as it used
to be in the days of the Roman Empire. It is a
great engineering problem and can be done by building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
a canal from the sea to allow the waters to flow
in. As a large part of the desert lies below sea
level, the water would naturally flood a large area.
As you know, the sun would evaporate a lot of this
water to be returned to earth in the form of rain,
which falling on the surrounding desert would soon
make it a fertile land.</p>

<p>“But this undertaking, as I understand it, will not
only change the climate of the Sahara but will affect
that of the entire world. At a meeting of the promoters
I heard it said that the result might be disastrous
to the rest of the world. But like any nation
or group of individuals seeking mere gain for
themselves, the rest of the world is not likely to be
taken into consideration.</p>

<p>“It would be a good thing for the world at large if
the Sahara could be revegetated, but it must not be
the cause of suffering. I would give anything a
woman can righteously offer to the one who will
prevent this destructive flooding. You see, it would
destroy my beloved homestead at the Gurara Oasis.”</p>

<p>“It can be done,” remarked Carl, as he drew a
pencil and a map from his pocket. He spread the
map on the table between them and using his pencil
as a pointer explained once more his mission in the
desert, assuring her, at the same time, that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
think of a plan by which the catastrophes she feared
would be avoided.</p>

<p>Sana was overcome with joy. Rising from her
chair, she clasped his hand with both hers, exclaimed,
“I have, indeed, found a friend in you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

THE LOVERS ON THE BEACH</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER a sleepless night, Carl arose early to
take a stroll and enjoy his pipe.</p>

<p>He had tried to woo sleep in every known
way, but in vain. In his mind’s eye lurked the face
of the girl he knew he loved better than anything
on this earth, and through his brain whirled her
promise to give anything a woman could offer to the
man who could save her home from destruction.</p>

<p>Sana had told him, the night before, that every
morning it was her custom to ride on horseback to
the not far distant Lake Faguibi. So Carl inquired
the way of the hotel keeper.</p>

<p>A few miles of brisk walking and he was at the
lake. Looking around, and seeing no one, he sat
down in a secluded spot, thinking of Sana and his
plan to flood the Sahara.</p>

<p>Time passed and Sana not yet coming into vision,
he took his binoculars from their case and adjusting
them, swept the surrounding country with his gaze.
Looking over the waters of the lake, he noticed, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
far from shore, a bather, enjoying a morning plunge.
Focusing his glasses, he saw it was Sana, swimming,
unhampered by even a bathing suit, in the blue-green
water.</p>

<p>Not wishing to spy on her he put down his glasses,
to while away the time with his pipe, until she should
have finished with her swim and had resumed her
attire.</p>

<p>After a time he again swung his glasses in the
direction in which he had last seen her. She was
no longer in the water. Leveling his binoculars on
the shore, he scrutinized the scene closely. Ah!
There she was. She was sitting on a stone behind
some shrubbery, with only her legs to be seen below
the foliage. She had evidently been out of the water
for some time for he noticed that she was dressed.</p>

<p>As he watched he saw a large butterfly alight on
her left knee, moving undisturbed toward the top
of her stocking. Sana was perhaps putting a finishing
touch to her hair, for her hands were not to be
seen. At any rate the butterfly resumed his progress
without fear.</p>

<p>That was all Carl could see and he studied the
scene for a while as he would have meditated on a
work of art. Surely the gods had given her beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">That was all Carl could see and he studied the scene for a

gods had given her beauty.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Putting his glasses aside, he fell into a reverie.
Full well did he realize that Sana was a woman of
exceptional beauty and passion, whose enchantments
could enslave and humiliate the proudest and crush
the mightiest. Was she aware of it? He did not
know. But if she was, why did she bury herself here
in the burning sands? She had a knowledge of love
and life, and Carl was certain she was anything but
lukewarm.</p>

<p>He gave her the benefit of the doubt, making up
his mind at the same time that he would do his best
to induce her to marry him and go to New York
with him.</p>

<p>How his friends would envy him, especially after
he had remained a bachelor for so long a time.
During the long years many a woman had tried to
weave about him the net of love. There had been a
time when he was legitimate prey to all kinds of
cheats and vamps, but his experiences with them had
taught him the cold calculating ways of the “gold
digger” and he had resolved never again to play
“Santa Claus.”</p>

<p>Carl, while having enjoyed life, became a man of
reserve and had never been anxious to be led to the
slaughter at the altar of matrimony. He did not
want to be a husband on paper only. He also knew
that man might come too late, but woman never.
But he was not a foolish boy who wrote letters to
a smart girl, who saved them with a definite object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
in view. He knew, too, that passionate love is the
source of little pleasure and of much suffering.</p>

<p>Would Sana leave the desert soil of her birth
for his sake?</p>

<p>Passion he once called evil, but now planted in his
heart it became virtue and joy. He and she would
be well matched. Carl had found his ideal.</p>

<p>Observations covering many years had taught him
that most men are fools so far as women are concerned
and that women are the most dangerous playthings
God ever devised. But, he reasoned, this was
generally caused by man’s own faults.</p>

<p>The favor Sana would win, as his wife, among his
friends he pictured in the brightest colors.</p>

<p>It did occur to him that Sana, with feminine instinct,
and so bewitching and beautiful a siren, could
easily turn his vision of paradise into real hell, after
she had brought him through a maelstrom of mad
passion, which she would unquestionably arouse
after having realized her full powers. “For woman,
nothing is impossible” used to be a saying of his.
But now, no such thoughts entered his head. He
was too much in love!</p>

<p>This time he was sure of it. There had been
times in his life when he had thought himself in love,
but luckily he realized the true state of affairs before
too late. How much sorrow and unhappiness could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
be spared us mortals if we could but see what the
future will bring.</p>

<p>Carl now thought of what had happened about a
year before.</p>

<p>At that time he was sure he loved a girl, Dorinda,
a young cloak model. He had taken lodgings temporarily
in a rooming house in New York, and it
so happened that Dorinda had the room over him.
He had met her casually and they had taken a great
liking for each other.</p>

<p>Dorinda was of the distinct flapper type, pretty
to be sure, a good dresser, but a girl without much
sense. Her one real ability, he now knew, was her
art of weeping. You know the sort. The girl who
crying bitterly relates her hard luck stories to arouse
your sympathy and generosity. Resolved though he
was against this very sort of thing, Carl like most
men proved an easy, and perhaps willing, victim.</p>

<p>That she came home at all hours of the morning
or entertained men in her rooms until late into the
night did not trouble Carl. His faith told him it
was all right.</p>

<p>Came an evening when he took her to dinner, as
he had done quite regularly for some time. Dorinda
leaning across the table said softly, tears in
her voice, “Carl, I have wanted to talk to you of
this for a long time. You know that I have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
friends to my room in the evening. I should not
have done it, but I did not know better. I was
wrong, but I did no wrong,” and taking his hand in
hers, she pleaded, “Tell me that you believe me,”
and when he assured her of his belief, Dorinda
pressed his hand, and with a trembling voice whispered,
“Thank you, Carl. I feel much better.”</p>

<p>She was relieved, but not Carl. He made her
promise that she would not be so foolish in the
future. And to all appearances she kept her
promise.</p>

<p>Returning from a short business trip, however,
Carl heard voices overhead until well into the morning.
The following day he reminded Dorinda of
her promise, but in a huff she left him without a
word of explanation.</p>

<p>For some time they saw nothing of each other.
But one evening she came to his door with an apology
on her lips. And Carl, fool-like, accepted the
apology. Immediately she launched into a recital of
intimacy, concerning the trouble a supposed girl
friend had gotten in. Carl listened quite attentively
it is true, but while listening put two and two
together.</p>

<p>But if it had not been for a few remarks between
the girl and the landlady, overheard by him on his
way to business, he never would have known the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
truth. He realized then his narrow escape. Suppose
he had asked her to marry him, as he had contemplated
for so long a time?</p>

<p>Now, Sana had crossed his path. But Sana, he
knew and rightly so, was not Dorinda.</p>

<p>He waited until she had stepped from behind the
bushes that had hidden her while dressing, before he
made his presence known.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Sana.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Lohman. What brings
you here—and so early?”</p>

<p>“Just taking a morning stroll to better enjoy my
pipe,” lying it is true, but he must not rush matters.</p>

<p>“It is rather a pleasant surprise to find you here
at the beach. We are generally alone here.”</p>

<p>“We?” Carl said in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she retorted, with a laugh, pointing to her
handsome white Arab that stood champing at its
bit a few yards away.</p>

<p>“Oh,” relieved of a million and one doubts.</p>

<p>Sana made a move as if to go away, when Carl
asked, “Are you in a hurry, or did I disturb you?”</p>

<p>“No, not at all.”</p>

<p>“Come, let us sit here on the grass awhile and
talk.”</p>

<p>Carl, looking at her closely, “Do you know, I
have been thinking quite a great deal of you since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
last evening. In fact you caused me a sleepless night—although
it was quite pleasant at that.”</p>

<p>Sana looked straight into his beaming eyes. A
smile played on her delicate lips.</p>

<p>“Is that possible, with all your American girls—your
alluring New York flappers?”</p>

<p>“The New York girl? Oh, she is a cold
proposition.”</p>

<p>“But if I kept you awake, how much must all
those American girls keep you awake? Do you ever
get much sleep? You know, I heard that New
York girls are quite capable of keeping men awake.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear,” interrupted Carl, “New York is
not America; you cannot judge America by New
York.”</p>

<p>“Are you serious? Why, I thought New York
was typical of what is American. Does not New
York set the pace for the entire country, and does
not the whole country fall in line, eager to do anything
that is approved by New York?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to some extent.”</p>

<p>“More than that. The other cities copy New
York’s buildings, her modes, her manners. Look
at the flapper of Broadway and Fifth Avenue. Why
all America is copying her, with her bobbed hair,
short skirts, generously rolled down stockings, lip
sticks, powder box and cigarettes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“I admit that, but what of it?”</p>

<p>“The trouble is that too many of your women are
just make believe, fata morganas. Your New York
girl is an illusion—an artist and a painter. She carries
her repair shop continually with her. Peep into
her hand bag and you will find rouge, powder puff,
lip stick, eye-brow pencil, nail file, chewing gum,
matches and a key.”</p>

<p>This Carl could not deny. He knew it was so,
but, as if to himself, he continued the topic, with
“The use of cosmetics is a necessity to most of our
girls. They do not have the same complexion as
have Swedish or German girls, for instance, and they
must resort to the artificial. But it is interesting,
and sometime quite amusing to observe how our
girls apply the art of make-believe. Of course, all
are not experts. One will often find that on a round
face the rouge has been applied to the center of the
cheek and the hair fluffed out at the sides. It would
have been better to have rouged up and down the
cheek bones with the hair drawn closely to the head.
In that way, an appearance of slimness would have
been obtained. On the other hand, one notices hollow
cheeks without rouge and a closely drawn coiffeur.
Had the hollows been rounded out with rouge
and the hair fluffed out that face would have been
really attractive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“But as a rule, they know their little game. Some
of them go to the extent of applying a touch of
rouge against the inner bridge of the nose and on the
ear lobes to give the effect of transparency.</p>

<p>“Take the girl with the so-called pug nose. She,
as a rule, experiences great difficulty in making that
nose fit in with the rest of her face. But it could
easily be done. A straight narrow line of face powder
along the nasal ridge, acting as sort of high light,
would give prominence to the nose.</p>

<p>“The whole matter of make-up can be compared to
an artist putting a finishing touch to a picture. If he
knows his art a few deft touches of the brush creates
harmony and beauty—if he doesn’t—well, just
another daub.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sana broke in, “but make-up is not the
only kind of cleverness for which your American
girls are admired. Take the matter of dress. Although
you have girls with hair of all shades, black,
brown, auburn, blonde—all seem to know what color
of hat, dress, shoes and stockings to choose. The
brunettes know how to pick yellow and orange and
the blondes light blues.”</p>

<p>“I have often noticed that, too. In that they are
adept. Too much so, perhaps, when one realizes
that a good many of them spend every cent they earn
just to match the outfit. Much of it, to a thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
person, is sheer waste. Some have a dress mania;
they are the least part of themselves, they become
manikins, of no greater value than their dresses.</p>

<p>“And the time they spend on their eye-brows and
lashes to give better expression to their eyes! Ye
Gods! Right in my own office at home it was so
noticeable that I have been working on a plan to
change the color of the eyes. You know, with some
people, the color of the eye changes temporarily, due
to internal feeling, and with this in mind I believe I
can perfect a plan. Think of the time it would save
you girls.”</p>

<p>“Change the color of the eyes?” Sana was
amazed. “Do you mean to say that, for instance,
light blue or grayish eyes could be made deep blue?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. I have experimented with other
subjects and it worked. I am positive it can be applied
to women’s eyes—but it would be a slow
process. Don’t they change the color of cut
flowers?”</p>

<p>Sana retorted, an impish look coming into her
eyes, “Oh, I see. You want your fair subject to
stand overnight with her feet in ink.”</p>

<p>“Not quite that,” laughing.</p>

<p>“But tell me, how it is that you, a man and an
engineer are so interested in feminine matters? I
suppose you change your sweetheart as often as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
do your tie, and that you have a large assortment of
ties.”</p>

<p>To which Carl made no response, so Sana, with a
gay laugh, continued “Your notebook must look
like a harem directory.”</p>

<p>Carl’s retort “Nothing doing” was snappy and
Sana hastened to sooth him with “Please do not
misunderstand me. But I’m curious to know how it
is you know so much about what women wear and
use. Isn’t it rather strange?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. To a large extent it has always
been rather an impersonal proposition—sort
of big brother like, you know. The girls would
come to me with all sorts of questions regarding
beauty, clothes, etc., and because I wanted to tell
them my true viewpoint, it was natural that I should
take an interest in them and their methods. To be
frank I learned, too, that even the deposit from a
lip stick does not taste so very bad.”</p>

<p>Sana, glancing at Carl from the corner of her
eyes, “I suppose you discovered that at a very early
age.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right. I came home from school
one day with the imprint of a pair of cupid’s bows
on my cheek, much to the merriment of my sister.
And those ‘bows’ weren’t left there by a city girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
either. She was a country lass, whose parents had
sent her to school in New York.”</p>

<p>“And from then on you were a lady’s man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. It’s all a question of
viewpoint. In fact it was just such misunderstanding
that changed my career. I wanted to be an artist—a
painter and sculptor. I had a great liking for
that and a certain amount of talent. But my parents,
misunderstanding my fondness for the feminine sex,
talked me out of it. They were sure I would never
succeed as an artist—my time, they said, would be
more occupied with my models than with my brush.
Perhaps they were right, one never can tell.”</p>

<p>“But I believe you would have made a good
artist.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” Carl smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, one can easily see that you are fond of
beauty and harmony—as for the rest, well, I can
tell.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes. My father taught me character reading.
Besides my mother showed me how to read the
palm.”</p>

<p>Carl stretched forth his hand to have her read
the lines, but Sana changed the subject: “But we are
drifting away from our topic—comparing the New
York girl with others. Comparing them with girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
of other American cities they are found to be much
alike. But when you compare her with a European
girl—ah, then you see the difference.”</p>

<p>“Such a comparison should be interesting. Let
me have your candid opinion.”</p>

<p>“First of all, take the French girl. She is a natural
charmer with a lovely body. She knows how
to attract male companions, gives them precisely
what they desire and then applies her knowledge and
ambition to controlling the male. That she does is
well known. That is the Parisienne. France like all
countries has a great variety of women. She has the
country girl and the city girl, and if a comparison
is to be made it must be between the country girl of
France and the country lass of America, between the
Parisienne and the New Yorker.</p>

<p>“Then consider the English, or rather the Anglo-Saxon
women. Their beauty is marred by the largeness
of the features. Their feet are also large. The
English woman, as records show, is at the top in the
average size of shoes. She is there with number
seven and a half; American women, with number
seven, come second; German, six and a half; France,
six; Spain, five and a half, and South America with
number five. As your country is made up of all
nationalities, the majority of them are German, then
the Irish and thirdly English, it is but logical that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the German element in your country caused the reduction—giving
your women a number seven shoe
as the average size. The limbs and features of
English women are angular, rawboned so to speak.
They are loose-fleshed and their dress—frightful.
While there are, of course, quite a few exceptions,
they, on the most part, cannot stand inspection.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, there is the German girl.
People are apt to decry them by comparing the
country girl of Germany with the city girl of other
countries. I am sure that you, an American, will
admit that you were most impressed with the musical
voices of the women, their long silky hair and
fine complexions. In those respects she cannot be
compared with the women of any other country.
The women as a rule are modest, orderly and home-loving.
What she knows, she knows thoroughly,
and she will not argue with you on a subject she does
not understand. In some countries it is just the
contrary. If she has the money and feels like dressing,
she does not overdress. But as a rule the average
German girl is not well dressed. That is
where the American girl has the great advantage.</p>

<p>“The Spanish and Russian women have their own
points of attraction. It has been said that the
women of Spain have the loveliest arms and shoulders.
I agree to that. It is also true of the refined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Russian woman. The average American girl has
slim arms, fashioned much after those of her Anglo-Saxon
sisters. Her shoulders, however, are more
apt to be round and fleshy, whereas those of the
Spanish and Russian women are flat. The Russian
women, too, have the faculty of mastering languages,
something that cannot be said of the average
Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>“The Italian girl blooms and fades early. When
in full bloom she is lovely, but the beauty seldom
lasts.</p>

<p>“But to get back to your American girl. Regardless
of what might be said to the contrary she is
superior to all in many ways. She is well dressed,
though at times underdressed. Either way, though,
she spends a great deal of time and money on
clothes.</p>

<p>“She paints, as you say, like an artist and as in
no other place on the globe. Her coiffure is always
neat and in fine trim. She is free to talk on things
that interest her and in that respect cannot be compared
with her hypocritical Anglo-Saxon sister. She
is independent and knows how to help herself out of
difficulties. She is a great charmer of men, but, as
your divorce records show, she does not seem to
know how to hold their affections.</p>

<p>“Of course, one cannot expect all the good qualities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
in one set of women. As a rule, however, the
American woman is superior to many.</p>

<p>“Take the American stage, for instance. No other
country has so many beautiful girls on the stage. Of
course, it is true that they are selected from all over
the country and are of different nationalities, but
they are essentially American.</p>

<p>“All in all, the American woman is to be admired.
Her style, grace and freedom of movement cannot
be found elsewhere. There is no doubt but what
most of her good examples are to be found in New
York. The most attractive ones seem to concentrate
in New York.</p>

<p>“But the trouble is that contact with men makes
the American woman more or less mercenary.
That, of course, is the man’s fault. You American
men are too apt to think of life as a mere matter
of dollars and cents, and it is only natural that your
women, hearing that doctrine preached from early
morning to late at night, should in turn become of
the same mind.”</p>

<p>Carl had no intention of arguing. He realized
that Sana had overlooked certain phases of American
life—he saw, too, that she did not speak of the
American woman as being high-strung, stubborn and
cranky at times, and that a great many of them
never know what they want.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>His words, therefore, did not betray his thoughts.
“Yes, I believe you are right. I admire your knowledge.
But, please do not compare New York with
our other cities. New York is not America, and
never will be.”</p>

<p>“But what, then, is America? In Chicago, Cleveland,
Denver or any large American city you are
told that these respective cities do not represent the
life and customs of the United States. Where, then,
will you find the true American?”</p>

<p>Carl shrugged his shoulders, replying, “You can
search me. But America cannot be judged by the
individual or by any group of individuals. America
is the melting pot of the world. All nations, all
creeds enter into the life of America. The nation
can only be judged as a nation. The national spirit
is the thing.”</p>

<p>“Even to the point of hypocrisy?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Your dry laws, for instance—what a farce!”</p>

<p>“You have got me there. On that point I cannot
argue. It is true that hypocrisy enters there. And
hypocrisy is the worst enemy a nation can have
within its borders. In the long run it leads to the
destruction of a nation as a great nation. Incalculable
good would be rendered a people if they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
only be made to understand and realize the dangers
of hypocrisy.”</p>

<p>“But what do you, as an American, think of the
dry laws?”</p>

<p>“I can only speak from a nonpartisan point of
view. I have never indulged to a great extent, so
the law had no personal effect on me. Theoretically
the country is as dry as the desert sands—practically
speaking it is as wet as it ever was. However, to
get a drink one must either go to another country or
be a law breaker in his own country. It is quite obvious
that all desiring a drink cannot travel to a
foreign land, so the law is broken.</p>

<p>“Of course, those who can afford to do so, go to
Cuba or Europe, and there, like your camels of the
desert, they fill themselves with the wine and beer
of Germany, the cognac and champagne of France,
the brandies and whiskies of England, to tide them
over the return.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, you are joking. It is really not as bad
as that, is it? But you know, when I was in New
York, I was given several recipes for the making of
home brews and wines. Seems as if the art of brewing
is becoming one of the greatest American accomplishments.
I brought the recipes home with me,”
laughing lightly. “Some day the Sahara may get
really dry and then I could make use of the formulas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Of course, I suppose I could, like your truly
patriotic Americans, indulge in water only. I used
to think that water was for ablution only, but it
seems that you Americans have discovered another
use for it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the ones who fostered the idea should
get an iron cross pinned on them, or, they should at
least receive the Nobel Prize as a reward for taking
away the personal liberties of a people and making
a crowd of hypocritical law breakers of them. The
part that hurts is that the people had no say in the
matter, whether they liked it or not. Yet the people
are the builders of the nation—the ones who have
contributed to its greatness.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of the contributions to a nation, what
struck me most forcibly in your country was the uniformity
and monotony in every city and town I visited.
That is, with a rare exception.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, you admit there was an exception.
Where was it?”</p>

<p>“My friend Mr. O’Brien had to make a business
trip to Bethlehem in Pennsylvania, so he took his
wife and myself with him in his car. We passed
through a number of New Jersey and Pennsylvania
cities and towns, and in the evening he took us to a
great county fair in Allentown, a city adjoining
Bethlehem. It was there that I found the exception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
to the rule so far as American cities are concerned.
Allentown certainly was different.</p>

<p>“Never before had I seen streets so well and so
uniformly lighted—even very much better than your
own Fifth Avenue in New York. Even Europe can
boast of nothing of the like. There was a touch of
the artist that appealed very much to me, and I believe
to all visitors to that town. That is, the lamp
posts have, near the lamp, large bowls that are always
kept filled with differently colored flowers and
trailing vines in summer, and evergreens, I understand,
in winter.</p>

<p>“In the middle of the public square was a great
granite monument, erected in honor of the Soldiers
and Sailors of Allentown. What impressed me
most was the lighting effect used to show the monument
at night. Nothing garish, like the Coney
Island effect, so many times seen in America, but the
whole was bathed in a soft glow that was extremely
effective and peaceful.</p>

<p>“We liked Allentown so much that we remained
overnight, and before leaving the following day,
took time to look around. To our surprise we
found the sidewalks and streets extremely clean,
which is the exception, as you know, for an industrial
city of some hundred thousand population.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
But everything was different, even the people seemed
different and more friendly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it,” was Carl’s dry answer.</p>

<p>“But as I said, it was an exception. Otherwise I
found all over the same streets, the same railway
stations, the same houses, the same stores, and the
same people in the same dress. They asked me the
same questions, using the same diction and the same
expression, in the same mechanical voice, accompanied
by the same sort of smile. Nothing individual
or original. Do all Americans think the
same, act the same?”</p>

<p>“Not by any means. You barely scratched the
surface. You did not see what was underneath.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but to me it seemed that everything,
animate and inanimate, bore the same mark of
standard uniformity imprinted on all with rubber
stamps cast from the same die. Why, in every city
I visited one could see on the sidewalks, floors of
public buildings, even in churches, the same round
marks of cast-away chewing gum. And in every city
it stuck to my shoes in the same way.”</p>

<p>She paused awhile, but Carl was too deep in
thought for words, so Sana continued:</p>

<p>“Yet, there is no other country on the face of the
earth that could be made so interesting in every walk
of life as your own, for, as you say, it is made up of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
people from all lands—they have given it the greatness
it possesses. But what is so contradictory of
the general state of life is the unique way in which
all the people seem to seek notoriety—the underdressed
women of the street and ballroom—the sensational
divorces and murders—the demands of the
blackmailers and the numerous clever ways in which
unassuming persons are cheated out of their hard
earned dollars by fraudulent schemers and consummate
rogues. Seemingly, this condition appears to
be a paradox, and so it would be if entirely separated
from the general plan of life, but it is inextricably
interwoven in the cosmic scheme—the
whole. Because someone has been successful in a
certain line, oblivious of its virtue or its evil, others
will pursue the same path in quest of wealth equal
to their brother. Yet considering all, I greatly admire
your country. It holds a spell of fascination
for me, although I cannot define it.”</p>

<p>“It is indefinable,” replied Carl, gazing far in the
distance.</p>

<p>Carl, although one could not say he was unattentive
to Sana in her discourse, was thinking of things
other than the subject of her remarks. Turning to
the girl, he asked, “Where did you learn the fascinating
dance you performed last night?”</p>

<p>“Oh that? Just a few steps which de Rochelle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
taught me while I was under hypnotic influence. A
friend of mine, Count von Sarnoff, called it the
‘Vampire Dance,’ after he had seen it.”</p>

<p>“Von Sarnoff? A Russian?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. A young Russian fellow—sporty to
an extreme I discovered, and deadly in love with
me.”</p>

<p>“Hmm. How did you get along with him? The
temperatures and temperaments of Russia and the
Sahara are two very different things and hardly to
be reconciled.”</p>

<p>“That is just what made it so fascinating—for a
time. Love speaks an international language, you
know,” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Indeed? Quite interesting”—coldly, then changing
his manner quickly, “But it would be most charming
to hear your story of the ‘Vampire Dance’.”</p>

<p>“If you promise not to say nasty things, or get
angry at what I tell you, I shall tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>Carl was but too anxious to learn anything and
everything relating to Sana, not to yield compliance
to this mild request. Her musical voice, her manner
and ways had already worked their charm. He
was even more in love than he imagined.</p>

<p>“Please tell me. I promise to be good.”</p>

<p>“Bear that in mind, then. It is not to everyone
I tell such things as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“After de Rochelle had disappeared I returned to
Europe where in Paris I met the Princess Cassandra,
a Russian. I traveled with her, as companion, over
Europe, visiting the various resorts and cities. At
Monte Carlo, while we were trying to lose our
money, I suppose, at one of the roulette tables, the
Princess recognized her nephew, von Sarnoff, who
had been winning steadily. He came over to our
table and after the usual introductions, played for
me. He seemed to have lots of luck and I won
more money than I had ever seen before. Then we
went to Baden-Baden, where de Rochelle put in an
appearance. I had him arrested while he was fighting
a duel because of me, and then I returned to my
desert home.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you were going to tell me the story
of the dance. How did you learn it?”</p>

<p>“The dance itself was an exotic movement that
had its birth in the mind of de Rochelle, who taught
it to me when I was in a trance. But he has passed
from my mind—he proved himself to be nothing but
an impostor—that is all.”</p>

<p>“But the dance you did last night would have been
impossible while wearing the long dresses and
clothes of civilization.”</p>

<p>Sana looked at Carl with pleading eyes, “Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
do you say that? The whole thing is distasteful to
me now when I think of it.”</p>

<p>Anxious though he was to hear the whole story,
Carl did not wish to force it from the girl, so kept
silent, looking out over the desert sands.</p>

<p>Sana, however, read his thoughts. Patting his
hand ever so lightly she resumed, “We are friends.
I can tell it to you. I know you will understand.
Perhaps it is for the best. Who knows?”</p>

<p>Carl, letting his gaze rest on her face, objected
with, “No—if it hurts you to tell it, I would rather
you would not.”</p>

<p>“But I promised I would. I shall keep my promise.
Only, please, please, do not think ill of me.
That would hurt more than the story.”</p>

<p>Before Carl could give voice to his thoughts, Sana
continued:</p>

<p>“As I said the dance was taught me while under
hypnotic influence. Upon coming out of the trance
I found that I had partly disrobed myself. I did not
realize it then, but I knew later that de Rochelle was
using me as a plaything. Not that he ever harmed
me. No. He always respected me.</p>

<p>“However, I would not advise any woman to subject
herself to hypnotic influence, even if the man be
her lawful husband, as I believed de Rochelle would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
some day be to me. It is wrong, very wrong. The
victim does just as the hypnotist wishes—tells him
everything—lets him analyze every feeling or passion.
Just how far he went with me I shall never
know, but I have shed many a bitter tear thinking of
the state I found myself in when coming out of a
trance.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl. I wish I had that devil here.”</p>

<p>“Please God, I shall never see him again. But
I have learned my lesson. A lesson I shall never
forget.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about the dance. Forget him, and tell
me that. You know I have never seen anything like
it. Was it not improved upon by you? I’m sure it
was.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was. You know my blood—gypsy blood—wild
and free. After having been taught the first
few steps the rest was easy. It was quite natural
that my gypsy blood should come to the fore when
I dance.</p>

<p>“It was at Baden-Baden that I first danced in
public. I was at a private entertainment given by
the young von Sarnoff. All of us had been drinking
more or less, and most of us were, as you Americans
would say, ‘a little tipsy.’ We were there to enjoy
ourselves and gave little heed or thought to the
morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Had I been sober I should never have let myself
be persuaded by flattering words and praise. But
the wine had gone to my head and I was easily led.
Von Sarnoff had been making a fool of himself generally,
drinking champagne from my slipper and
making ardent love to me. Then he asked me to
dance for them. There had been several quite
risque performances that evening and in my madness
I knew I could outdo them all. So I got on the
table, threw aside my remaining slipper and danced
for them. Without realizing it, I dropped my outer
garment while dancing. At the end of the dance I
found myself standing there in my little pink combination
suit.</p>

<p>“Von Sarnoff refused to return my gown, but I
managed to wrap myself in a table cover. It was
von Sarnoff who christened me the ‘virtuous vampire
dancer.’ Just how much vamping I do in my
dance I never know. No doubt you and the other
watchers last night could tell it better than I. But
the name lingered in my mind, and so I have named
it the ‘Dance of the Vampire’.”</p>

<p>Carl, eager-eyed, “Really I must confess I did not
pay much attention to the dance. My eyes were on
the dancer. Suppose you show it to me now.”</p>

<p>“No, not now. Some other time. Perhaps after
you return once more to our great desert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Then I suppose I shall have to wait. But tell
me, dear, why did you come to this out of the way
corner of the earth after spending so much of your
time in the great cities and resorts of the world?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I soon tired of that false life. So I decided
to join my mother, who, after my father’s death had
moved here from the Gurara Oasis. This used to
be her old home, you see. Here at least I can live
a natural life, free from what you call civilization.
Of course, even here one must make a living, so that
is why I dance. They look at such things differently
here. A woman can be a dancer and still be considered
good, but in Europe—well you know. Besides
it is great fun to be able to ride around free
as the air, in native dress, although sometimes I
masquerade in European style.”</p>

<p>“Sana, I admire the frankness with which you
have related your experiences to me. I am glad, for
your sake, that you have returned here. I hope, too,
that you believe me when I say I know none of those
happenings were brought about through fault of
yours.”</p>

<p>“I do believe you.”</p>

<p>“As for your dance,” resumed Carl, “it is worthy
of all the praise bestowed upon it, and I....”</p>

<p>“Oh, your American girls are equally as good
dancers. I learned, too, that they were very clever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
in ridding themselves of their stays when at dances.
‘Parking them,’ I believe they call it. Of course,
we of the desert do not wear such things at all. We
have our own mode of costume and dress.”</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated and then continued,
“I have often wondered why in America, such a
large good-natured country, full of foreign elements,
the very forefathers of the country did not do something
to maintain their national costumes in the
mode of dress. How much more interesting it
would be to see the dress of the American Indian,
the true American, and that of the earlier settlers,
instead of everyone trying to pattern their clothes
after the so-called latest European fashions?</p>

<p>“How much more interesting and picturesque it
would be to see Turks, Chinese, Japanese, Russians,
Greeks and Swedes in their national costumes, instead
of appearing as if all are of a single mind.</p>

<p>“Many of your people travel through foreign
lands to study foreign ways, while, in fact, you have
everything in your own country, so far as peoples
and their customs are concerned. Why deny it?</p>

<p>“I noticed too that you have but one official language.
Perhaps it is best, but then take the case of
Switzerland, much smaller in population than the
city of New York. There they have three official
languages and get along wonderfully. Everyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
has the opportunity of learning three languages,
which is a great thing to be sure. German, French
and Italian are not called foreign or alien tongues in
Switzerland. The very word ‘foreign’ specifies the
limits of one’s knowledge.”</p>

<p>All this while Carl had been thinking of just one
thing. That was to secure Sana for himself. Sana,
he was sure, brought up under the strict discipline of
her father and with her broad views of life, would
be a safer wife to him than the cold blooded, calculating
New York propositions, as he called them,
most of whom do not know what they want, and flit
from man to man as occasion demands.</p>

<p>To suit his purpose, he changed the conversation,
taking her hand into his. To his delight she made
no attempt to prevent his doing so.</p>

<p>“Do you intend staying here in this wilderness?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for some little time. Sooner or later,
mother and I shall return to the Gurara Oasis, where
I was born.”</p>

<p>“You mean you will never leave the desert?” Carl
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, not that I know of. I do not care for European
life.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, how about America, New York?”</p>

<p>“I confess I do like New York, with its shops, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
plays and excitement. Oh, yes, I like those funny
little places in Greenwich Village, I believe you
call it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that ‘nut section.’ They are rather unconventional
there. Who took you there?”</p>

<p>“My friend, Mrs. O’Brien, myself and two men
friends of hers visited it one night, strolling from
place to place. We had dinner and danced at the
‘Greenwich Village Inn’ and went also to the ‘Black
Cat’ and the ‘Pirates’ Den’—the pirates there were
rather tame, though.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to return to America, to New
York, to the Village, in company of a great admirer
of yours?”</p>

<p>“I do not know who that could be,” turning her
head away from him.</p>

<p>“Assume that he would be sitting at present at
your side, holding your hand.”</p>

<p>Sana tried to withdraw her hand at this, but Carl
held it the tighter. He leaned toward her, taking
the other hand too, and whispered softly, “Sana,
dear, look at me. Ever since I met you on the
bridge that afternoon you have filled my dreams. I
despaired of ever seeing you again, and life did not
seem worth the living. When I saw you again last
night it was in a dream. Thoughts of you kept me
awake all night. Will you return to America as my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
wife? You know I love you and love you dearly.
And I think you care for me too.”</p>

<p>The girl was a little uneasy, as if at a loss to know
what to do or say. Her gaze ranged the distant
horizon as she slowly replied, “You may be right
with regard to the last—I cannot say. But I will
admit I couldn’t sleep last night myself. That we
should meet here I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Sana, dear, answer my question,” pleaded Carl,
trying to draw her to him gently.</p>

<p>The question was never answered, for, with a
sudden jerk Sana freed one hand and slapped herself
on the neck. A bee, stunned by the blow, fell into
her lap.</p>

<p>Sana made a grimace and touching carefully the
spot where the bee had left its sting, remarked, “I
believe it is swelling.”</p>

<p>Carl now took matters into his own hands.
Drawing her gently to him, her shoulder against his
bosom, he studied the red mark, saying, “I don’t
think it is poisonous, but it certainly is swelling.”</p>

<p>With Sana’s body quivering in his arms he pressed
the spot tenderly with his fingers. A sudden thought
shot through his mind and he added softly, “Let me
take out the poison.” Without waiting for response
he bent over her, pressing his lips upon her neck to
suck out the poison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The warmth of her velvet-like flesh made his head
swim to the music of the gods.</p>

<p>Sana was blushing a brilliant red, like a poppy,
Carl thought, and she tried to get free. He held
her all the closer now; his hand inadvertently upon
her breast which was, he felt, beginning to move
stormily. Her resistance did not last long. Soon
she lay quite still, her shoulder against his bosom.
His bosom, too, was heaving mightily as he pressed
his lips tightly against her neck, while Sana slightly
parted her quivering lips, breathing heavily and
slowly, her body exhaling a sweet fragrance like the
aroma of a sun-kissed rose.</p>

<p>Carl knew it as that of an untouched blossoming
flower and he was happy! Her heart, under his
hand, told him too, of her feelings, and lifting his
lips slightly, he murmured, “Sana, I love you. Be
mine,” and his cheek brushed against her warm neck.</p>

<p>His passionate kisses upon her neck startled Sana
for a moment. She became conscious of his hand
upon her rising breast, but in her ecstasies of bliss,
she did not resist.</p>

<p>Her long drawn breaths became more passionate;
her limbs were rigid with fire. Finally, stretching
her body slowly, she turned around in his arms.
Her loving eyes which had changed from their grayish
blue to pure blue, were shining with fire, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
looked at Carl, who holding her before him, whispered,
“Honey, dearest, be mine.”</p>

<p>In answer to his plea, she crept closer to him and
threw her bare arms around his neck and drew him
gently closer. But Carl clasping her body feverishly
in his arms, held her, looking steadily into her
starry bright eyes, as if dissecting the passion raging
in her body, and he drank the breath of her sighing
emotion. With a soft “my desert star,” his lips covered
her quivering mouth. In a passion of fire,
clasping their arms still tighter, they experienced
that moment of ecstatic bliss when passing time
leaves no trace. Heart to heart, lips to lips, they
lay there, tight in each other’s arms, in an ecstasy of
happiness.</p>

<p>In his glory, Carl could think of nothing more
sensible to say that “That little bee surely left sweet
honey upon your neck.”</p>

<p>“As sweet as me?” she asked mischievously.</p>

<p>Bending over and kissing her neck once more, he
answered, “Sweeter than sugar, but only half as
sweet as you.” With that he showered her neck
and shoulders with kisses.</p>

<p>Forgotten in a moment was the past with its many
trials, unthought of was the future—the present
alone existed for the two so closely clasped in love’s
embrace. Those moments of rapture were like premeditated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
bits of eternity. The world and all its
vain dreams could not give the supreme madness of
joy which they experienced in silence and solitude.
The kisses they drank from each other’s lips were
sweeter than the honey of Hymettus. Their corporal
beings seemed to vanish and dissolve away,
while their souls merged into one whose aspirations
were boundless, whose thoughts knew not words and
whose pleasures were not of this earth.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when Sana at
last released herself from Carl’s arms.</p>

<p>“Come, Carl dear. We must be going. I
shouldn’t wonder but what mother is already very
anxious for me.”</p>

<p>Arm in arm they sauntered homeward, along the
quiet shore of the Niger—that river of history,
Sana’s horse following behind them, puzzled, no
doubt, over the strange being who came and caused
his mistress to neglect him so.</p>

<p>They had strolled but a short distance, when they
heard a woman’s cry. Their soaring flights of fancy
were brought quickly to earth by the almost unearthly
yells and shrieks.</p>

<p>Looking around they perceived a negro girl chasing
a large monkey that was running away with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
clothing. It had chosen an opportune moment for
its mischief while the dark damsel was enjoying a
swim.</p>

<p>Carl and Sana hurried toward the scene of the
chase, but as they neared the spot, they saw the monkey
suddenly turn and attack the girl. Flashes of
livid flame sparkled maliciously in its small beady
eyes, as it made the fatal spring. It was about to
rend the throat of its victim, when it observed Carl
coming toward it, revolver in hand. Crazed now
with fear, the animal leaped from the prostrate negress
and lunged at Carl, its new enemy. A well
directed shot, and it was over. The hairy thing fell
dead at Carl’s feet, while the negress, recovering
from her fear, and embarrassed at the presence of
the man, got up quickly and without so much as
stooping to pick up her clothing, rushed away into
the water, resembling nothing so much as an animated
puppet of ebony.</p>

<p>Sana’s mother, a gypsy not of the type Carl had
often seen traveling through America, was waiting
at the door of her modest home. She greeted Carl
in friendly fashion when introduced by Sana. She
had heard of him, she said, and thanked him profusely
for the aid he had given her daughter.</p>

<p>She was quite surprised when Carl asked her for
Sana’s hand in marriage. That would be up to Sana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
entirely, she told him, and if Sana was satisfied she
would be satisfied also.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, Sana threw herself into Carl’s
arms exclaiming that that had already been settled.</p>

<p>Much to Carl’s delighted surprise he found that
his future mother-in-law was a woman of distinct
culture and refinement, something he had not expected
to see in a gypsy. Together they spoke for
quite a time, discussing many things of mutual
interest.</p>

<p>The talk reverted to Sana’s father, of whom the
mother had only words of praise. Apparently he
had tried hard in the last years of his life to make
up for the foolishness of his youth. Excusing herself,
Sana’s mother left the room, returning shortly
with a manuscript in pencil. Handing it to Carl, she
explained, “My husband wrote this just before his
death. He was a great student of astronomy and
this data he compiled as the basis for a book, but he
died before he could have it published.”</p>

<p>Noting that Carl perused the manuscript with
great interest she continued, “You may have it, if
you wish. I understand you are a writer and it may
be of inspiration to you. Take it and use it. Perhaps
he who wrote it will sometime know that his
work did amount to something.”</p>

<p>Urged by Sana, Carl readily accepted the data,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
thanking the mother, and promising to read it carefully
during his travels across the desert. He was
sure, he said, that it would prove of great help and
value to him sometime.</p>

<p>Carl was about to take his leave to return to the
hotel, when Sana, recalling something to mind, said,
“Mother, read Carl’s hand, please.”</p>

<p>This the gypsy consented to do, motioning to Sana
to go outdoors, as they would have to be alone.</p>

<p>“Shall I cross your palm with silver?” Carl
laughed.</p>

<p>“No, that is necessary only with professionals.”</p>

<p>Taking Carl’s hand in hers, she studied the lines
carefully, and in an earnest tone, began, “I see danger—great
trouble for you—very soon—you are
going to lose your best friend. Yes. Some man is
going to take that friend away from you!”</p>

<p>She paused for a while, then seriously, “You are
going to have a serious accident, but you will recover.
I also see another dark girl coming into your
life, whom you should not trust. You are going to
take a long journey across the water, and that girl
will be with you.”</p>

<p>Carl, thinking the girl to be Sana, interrupted with
“What will become of her?”</p>

<p>“You will cast her away after you have crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the water and you will have a great deal of worry
over the other girl, whom you really love.”</p>

<p>Carl did not know what was what, nor who was
who, and asked for a description of both girls, to
which the gypsy replied, “Both are dark haired and
beautiful. The one means well, the other does not.”</p>

<p>Carl, desirous to learn as much as he could, asked
to be told the final outcome, but the only answer he
got was, “That, one cannot say. But everything will
turn out as you want it to be.”</p>

<p>This in a measure satisfied Carl. He knew how
he wanted things to turn out. At any rate he was
of too practical turn of mind to give much weight
to a palm-reading.</p>

<p>Taking leave of the mother he joined Sana outdoors.
They chatted a while, making plans for a
trip on horseback the following day.</p>

<p>After Carl had gone, Sana was told by her
mother that she was sorry that she had read Carl’s
future and warned Sana of the danger ahead.
While Sana believed devoutly in her mother, she
dismissed the fear that harm might come to herself,
but she was worried in regard to Carl.</p>

<p>Upon learning of the proposed excursion into the
desert the following day, her mother tried to persuade
Sana not to go, but the girl only answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
“If it is predicted that certain things will happen,
they will happen; all one can do is to await the
time and take it good naturedly.”</p>

<p>Arguments were useless, for Sana simply said,
“Your reading of the future would not be of any
value if the happenings you predict could be prevented
in time,” adding, with a little smile, “You
don’t want to be considered a faker, do you dear?”</p>

<p>To which there was no answer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

IN THE CLUTCHES OF AN AMOROUS
CAVE MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SANA in breeches and short riding jacket, stood
at the side of her restless steed when Carl
arrived on horseback. It was an ideal day
for an outing and spiritedly they trotted off to the
desert.</p>

<p>Sana was radiantly happy at the prospect of enjoying
the freedom of the desert with her lover.
Too soon, far too soon, he would have to leave her
and she was glad to have him alone for the day.</p>

<p>Her horse, the white Arab, was an exceptionally
fine but nervous beast. Carl’s mount was a tame
mare in comparison and Sana teased him, saying,
“I bet that you cannot catch up with me.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll bet you a kiss,” Carl retorted.</p>

<p>“But if I win?”</p>

<p>“It will suit me.”</p>

<p>“But if I lose?”</p>

<p>“That will suit me also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“I must say, you are some sport, Carl. Don’t
you want to hold the stakes too, so that you will
surely be on the safe side?”</p>

<p>With that she chuckled to her horse and it leaped
ahead with wide swinging strides, leaving Carl to
follow suit. Try as he would, it was a useless task.
He had to content himself with the dust clouds from
the flying heels of the Arab, as it carried Sana far
ahead over the burning sands.</p>

<p>A few miles of this and Sana slowed up a bit, so
that Carl might catch up with her. With a smile
she reminded him of his lost wager, which Carl
promptly paid her with interest.</p>

<p>Proceeding again, they moved swiftly northward
over the level plain. Here and there they came
upon an isolated group of palm trees and small
bushes, partly burned up by the hot rays of the
desert sun. Otherwise, there was nothing but sand
before them and a clear cloudless sky overhead.
But the sand and the heat mattered not to the lovers,
as riding side by side, they paved the road of
their future with bricks of shining gold!</p>

<p>At last it was time for them to turn back. Sana
knew of a shorter route home and suggested that
they take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_155">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_155.jpg" alt="They paved the road
of their future with bricks of shining gold">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">Enjoying the freedom of the great desert, they paved the road
of their future with bricks of shining gold.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>They trotted along for several hours, when Carl
saw a dwelling in the distance. As they drew nearer
they heard strains of music and Sana suggested going
in and asking for refreshments.</p>

<p>At the gate a Berber woman asked them what
they wanted. Sana told her, whereupon she led
them into a dimly lighted room. They found places
on the floor, apart from a group that sat near a
small platform, at the side of which lounged a fierce
looking fellow, playing a strange musical instrument.</p>

<p>Wine and cakes being served, they paused to
watch a dancer who had stepped on the platform.
The dancer, a girl of hardly sixteen, was very scantily
clad and her dance consisted mainly of twistings
of the body, accompanied with meaningful flashes of
the eyes. At first she seemed rather timid, but at
the shout “Cintani, put some life in it,” she distorted
her body until there was no doubt as to the meaning
of the emotions she was endeavoring to express—much
to the delight of the Arabs in the room.</p>

<p>The one whose command she had so eagerly
obeyed was, as Sana whispered to Carl, Amshied, a
Berber chieftain, and the three husky females at his
side were known to be his consorts.</p>

<p>After the dancer had gone, the musician placed
a snake on the platform. He then commenced to
charm it with the whistling of a fife, to which the
snake responded readily, much to the surprise of
Carl, who, not believing it would be noticed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
darkness, took Sana’s hand and pressing it to his
lips, said, “That is more than a man can do to a
woman.”</p>

<p>His act, however, was noticed by Amshied, who
turning to his women said, in a low voice, “Watch
that pair. One of them is a woman. If I am right,
I know who she is and who wants her. At any rate
they shall not leave. I’ll take care of the woman,
and you three can share the man.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he arose from the floor and went into
another room, where he knew de Rochelle was waiting.
Motioning de Rochelle to the door, he nodded
at Sana, asking, “Is that the one you spoke of this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Can you manage to secure her?”</p>

<p>“Have I not managed many things? It shall be
done. But first the gold.”</p>

<p>De Rochelle paid him his price and sat down to
wait, believing that at last Sana was in his hands.
Little knew he, however, of the plans lurking in
Amshied’s skull.</p>

<p>When Amshied returned to his place, he spoke a
few curt words to the women, who now stepped to
the platform and performed amazing feats of
strength, revealing the while their muscular limbs
and bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Sana was astounded and turned to Carl, saying,
“They are regular amazons—desert amazons.”</p>

<p>This exhibition finished, Carl looked at his watch
and seeing that it was quite late, helped Sana up
from the floor and prepared to leave.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Amshied stepped forward, as if to
escort them to the door.</p>

<p>Stepping on a small carpet, Sana and Carl felt the
floor beneath them give way. Carl made a vain
effort to throw Sana to safety, but failed when Amshied
gave him a shove that sent man and woman
headlong into the pit beneath. Their fall was
broken by a heap of rugs beneath the trap, so that
neither suffered any physical harm. The room in
which they found themselves was in total darkness.
Besides, it was filled with a suffocating smoke that
crept into their lungs, burning and stifling them. In
vain they sought means of escape, falling at last insensible
to the ground.</p>

<p>Some minutes later, or so it seemed to him, Carl,
who, although he had recovered his senses was unable
to move, owing to the effects of the drugged
smoke he had inhaled, saw a small door open,
through which entered Amshied and the three
women. The chieftain tossed Sana, who was still
unconscious, over his shoulder, as if she were a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
bundle of rugs and carried her off, whither Carl
knew not.</p>

<p>As for himself, he was left to the mercies of the
three amazons. Chatting gaily among themselves,
in a language unknown to Carl, they carried him upstairs
to a small room. Here they threw him upon a
rough couch like bed, fastening his legs and arms
with shackles attached to the four legs.</p>

<p>Helpless, he lay there, thinking of what would
happen to his beloved. What fate was in store for
her? Desperately he struggled to free himself from
his chains, but it was useless. He was as helpless
as a pig trussed for the butcher’s knife.</p>

<p>To his disgust, his own position was brought
clearly home to him, when the three women commenced
pawing over his body, in the same way as
one would examine an animal on the auction block.
Resist he could not; he was forced to submit to their
intimate inspection, which, he thanked his stars, did
not last long. Satisfied as to his physical make-up,
the women suddenly assumed various poses about
his couch, vying with each other for Carl’s attention.
Carl, however, rolled his head from side to side,
closing his eyes to convey to them as clearly as he
could his desire to have nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>Determined they were, however, to show their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
charms to their captive. One by one they came over
to his corner, each trying harder than the other to
arouse in him some indication of desire. Carl managed
to keep his eyes tightly closed for a time, but
his thoughts were too bewildered, his mind too much
filled with Sana, to allow him to do so long. Opening
his eyes, he saw one of the women still moving
around before him. With a rage caused by disgust,
Carl gave vent to a string of oaths. These had the
desired effect. Perhaps the woman did not understand
their meaning, but the meaning of his voice
was clear. At any rate she decided not to make him
any angrier and left through a small side door and
bolted it.</p>

<p>He lay gazing around the room as best he could.
Did that drapery in the far corner move? He
watched closely. Yes, it was moving. What now?
It was pushed aside, and through a small opening
crept a figure. A woman, he perceived, but who?
Coming into the light he recognized the dancer
whom the Berber had called Cintani. Was he to go
through another ordeal of the kind he had just been
subjected to?</p>

<p>Maddened by his helplessness, he was about to
scream out a curse, when the girl whispered, in poor
French, “Keep quiet—I will help you.”</p>

<p>Tip-toe she crept towards him. To his relief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Carl saw that she had other intentions than to charm
him. From her girdle he saw her take a key. With
quick fingers the shackles were unlocked and Carl
set up, free!</p>

<p>He could but look his thanks—he had no time for
words, for again, with cautioning finger the slave-girl
whispered, “The girl—the one you came with,
come!”</p>

<p>Taking Carl’s arms she led him across the room,
stopping before a great rug, suspended curtain-wise
from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“In there,” she whispered, and was gone.</p>

<p>Carefully Carl moved the rug aside. It concealed
a heavy wooden door. And on the other side!</p>

<p>Peering through a small hole in the door Carl
saw Sana lying on a heap of cushions, while Amshied,
back to Carl, knelt beside her, caressing and
fondling her. Sana was still happily insensible to
her predicament.</p>

<p>With an effort, Carl suppressed a cry. He felt
for his revolver. He recalled, then, that the women
had taken it away from him. He looked about the
room. Not a thing that would serve as a weapon
was to be had.</p>

<p>He tried the door. To his relief it was unlocked.
Slowly he slid it open. A low growl, coming from
somewhere at his side made him jump back in alarm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
No, there was nothing in the room with him. Again
a growl, accompanied with the sniffing of an animal.
Desperate, Carl pulled the rug aside. To his horror
he saw an iron-barred door, behind which, stretched
full length on the floor, lay a huge Nubian lion—the
black lion of the deserts—the king of the lion tribe.
Should the lion roar or spring at the door, Carl
realized with a flash, all was lost. Amshied would
be aroused from his sensual desires, and all hope of
rescue would disappear. To his amazement, the
lion merely yawned and blinked his eyes. Often had
he seen just such a scared human at the other side of
his door. No need of hurrying, no need of wasting
breath. Sooner or later the feast would be his!</p>

<p>The two doors were connected at the top by an
iron rod, so fixed that when either door was slid
open the other opened also. Carl saw at a glance
that he could slide the one door and get into the
other room before the lion had time to get out, for
as soon as he was through he could close the door
against the lion. But, he reasoned, suppose the lion
did manage to squeeze through while he was getting
into the other room. Then if there was no other
available exit out of the other room, things would be
worse than before. He would be trapped.</p>

<p>What could he do? Once more his gaze roamed
about the room. His eyes rested on the couch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Yes, that might answer. His fears for Sana gave
him speed. It was but the work of a moment to
get that couch and prop it upright against the door
of the den. Fortunately for Carl the workmanship
of the door was none too good. Near the floor the
masonry had fallen away, exposing the bars of the
framework. Unmindful of the sniffing lion, Carl
forced the chains nearest the door through the bars,
secured the chains and brought them through to his
side of the cage. The suddenness of his movements
took the lion unawares, and it made no move at
Carl, but drew slightly back in fright. The locks
were snapped and Carl stood up to contemplate his
work. It might do? But he had his doubts. What
would happen when he opened the door to get at
Amshied?</p>

<p>As he pondered for a moment, a cry came to his
ears. Sana had awakened from her stupor to find
the grinning face of Amshied close to hers.</p>

<p>With a smothered cry, Carl slid the door aside
sufficiently to squeeze through and sprang into the
room.</p>

<p>The lust-ridden Berber had partly torn Sana’s
clothing from her, and was forcing his attentions
upon her. The girl, horrified with fear, tried to free
herself from his grip.</p>

<p>But a whirlwind was upon him. He had no time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
to get to his feet nor make any attempt to defend
himself. With a fierce lunge Carl literally threw
himself upon Amshied, forcing him to the floor.</p>

<p>Although taken by surprise as he was, Amshied
was no weakling. Carl soon found this out when
with a violent twist of his body Amshied rolled
over and clutched at Carl’s throat. With a trick
learned at school Carl broke the hold, but Amshied
was endowed with brute strength and he seized Carl
around the body with both arms. Together they
rolled across the floor, bringing up with a thud
against the door.</p>

<p>They lay in deathlike embrace for a moment,
panting from their exertions. Carl realized that
Amshied was more than his match so far as mere
strength was concerned. To overcome his antagonist
he would have to resort to trickery. Heaving
a deep sigh, as if utterly exhausted and unable to
continue, he let his body relax. To his delight,
Amshied was fooled completely. Believing Carl to
be done for, he released his hold for a moment.
Brief though this respite was, it was sufficient for
Carl. Feeling the arms loosen ever so slightly, he
suddenly twisted around, and with a quick movement
of his knees had lifted Amshied, throwing him heavily
on his side. At the same time Carl pinned his
opponent with a neck lock, and rolling him over,
placed his knee in the small of Amshied’s back and
pressed.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Amshied struggled fiercely to free himself from
the encircling arm that was slowly choking him to
death. His efforts, however, were useless. Carl
hung on with a desperate strength.</p>

<p>Slowly the other weakened, his breathing became
more and more strained under the pressure on his
throat and back. At last his body relaxed. Apparently
he was unconscious. But Carl took no chances.
Still retaining his grip, he rose to his feet. Then
with a mighty heave he threw the senseless man to
the further end of the small room, where he fell in
a huddled heap to the floor. Carl noted, then, that
Amshied’s head was grotesquely twisted to one side.
He would bother them no more!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Carl rushed to Sana, who had watched the struggle
with bated breath. He sought to take her in his
arms to carry her to freedom. But freedom was not
to be theirs so soon. The three amazons were upon
them. With wild shrieks they attacked Carl, who,
not caring whether they were women or not, let them
have the full force of his blows. Sana was at his
side, with scratching nails and kicking feet. Another,
too, came to their aid. Cintani coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
through the door, saw the struggle and with eager
fists did her best to help.</p>

<p>The amazons soon had enough of fighting and
with wild cries ran from the room, followed by Carl,
Sana in his arms. His thoughts, now, were only to
get away from that devilish place. Cintani, running
at his side, grasped his arm and led him through a
door out into the open. Smoke was pouring from
the house. Someone had set it afire.</p>

<p>Their horses were still tied to a palm, nearby.
Sana asked to be set down, and doing so, Carl did
not notice the half-naked savage who crept up behind
him, felling him senseless to the ground with
a blow of a club.</p>

<p>Before Sana or the slave-girl could make any attempt
to escape the savage, now joined by three
others, was upon them. Struggle as they would
they were helpless in the hands of these men. Sana
had often heard stories of the cavemen who were
said to live in the hills of the desert. Could it be
possible that these four savages were such? Nothing
seemed to fit them better than that name.</p>

<p>If they were men they surely did not look the
part. They resembled monkeys more than anything
else. Squat, long armed and covered with hair, they
looked like giant denizens of a tropical forest.
Their protruding jaws displayed tusk-like teeth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
while their receding foreheads ran back to red wool-like
hair that covered their heads, shoulders and
upper back.</p>

<p>Uttering growls, that sounded as unhuman as they
looked, the larger of the four men, evidently the
leader, took Sana up in his arms and started off.
One of the others threw Cintani across his shoulders
as if she were but an animal that had fallen victim
to the chase.</p>

<p>Like a gift from heaven, unconsciousness came to
Sana.</p>

<p>Carl, lying unconscious for several hours, came
to in the early hours of the morning. Under the
bright gleam of the desert stars he saw nothing but
a heap of ashes and charred timbers—the remains
of Amshied’s dwelling.</p>

<p>His head still reeling from the blow he had received,
he crawled to his feet and looked around
for some sight of his beloved one. With a shock,
he discovered in the ruins, several charred skeletons,
totally beyond point of recognition. Carefully he
studied them, going from one to the other in an attempt
to find something by which to identify them.</p>

<p>Bewildered he stood up, kicking the ashes aside
with the toe of his boot. Good God, what was
that? Sana’s necklace! He stooped to examine
his find. Yes, it was the necklace Sana had worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
that morning when she started out on the ride with
him. He was positive it was the same, for he had
examined it closely then, commenting upon its
uniqueness. Was this then the end of Sana—the
end of life itself? Among those charred bones, he
believed, lay all that was earthly of the woman he
loved!</p>

<p>Heart heavy with anguish, his body trembling as
with the ague, he knelt in prayer. The words came
slowly—it was years since he had prayed—but in his
heart he knew what he wanted to say.</p>

<p>With shaking hands he scooped a shallow grave
in the sand, and in it placed the remains of the
bodies. He must be sure that Sana’s body found a
grave. The tears streamed from his eyes as he
carefully filled that last resting-place. The heaviest
timbers he could find he laid across the grave, lest
some prowling beast of the night should disturb the
bodies. Above the little mound he fashioned a rude
cross, from two smaller pieces of charred timber,
and with a pencil he printed a marker on a piece of
paper and pinned it to the cross.</p>

<p>Unmindful of the terrific heat of the desert sun
which beat down upon him, he stumbled on, in a
direction he believed would take him to the city.
Luck was with him. Late that afternoon he reached
Sana’s home, wild-eyed and fever-tortured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Sana’s mother saw at a glance that some terrible
accident had happened. But Carl’s parched lips
craved water, and putting her fears aside for the
moment she wet his lips, bathed his dust-covered
face and let him drink.</p>

<p>Then he spoke. Slowly he told the story. The
old mother seemed to age before his eyes, as she
moaned, “Sana, my child. Did I not warn you?”
between her tears, as she sat rocking to and fro on
the floor.</p>

<p>The minutes grew into hours and the two still sat
there in silence—a silence broken only by the moans
of the mother and a frequent sob or sigh from the
man.</p>

<p>At last Carl roused himself from his lethargy.
The desert fever had spent itself—his mind was
once more clear, but his heart was heavy laden.</p>

<p>“What should he do? Whither was he going?”
ran through his mind as he stood up from his chair.</p>

<p>As if reading this thought, the gypsy spoke, “You
have your work to do. It was willed that this should
happen. It is also written that you must do your
duty. Your caravan leaves tomorrow. Join it and
peace be with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is best. I could not stay here now.”</p>

<p>He bade her a sad farewell and going to his hotel
finished his preparations for the journey. This over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
with, he threw himself, fully clad, upon the bed to
while away those long dreadful hours before the
dawn.</p>

<p>Sana returned to consciousness to find that the
cavemen had camped for the night in a valley
formed by the sand dunes. To her great relief,
they did not bother about her or Cintani, but sat
apart from them chattering in guttural tones, later
to lie down to sleep.</p>

<p>Early next morning, the girls were again picked
up and the savages set out with them for their home
in the hills. The very thought of being clutched so
tightly in the arms of the beast-like man, who held
her close to him robbed her of all consciousness and
she knew nothing of her travels until she came to
with a start, lying on the ground with bound feet,
surrounded by a strange group of men, women and
children, in front of a large cave. The women and
children, like the men, of whom Sana saw five, wore
little or no clothing.</p>

<p>Physically, the women were better proportioned
than the men, but they too looked more like animals
than human beings. The women, however, had
taken some pains to appear attractive to their men.
One had a green feather stuck in her hair, while
another had chosen a bunch of twigs for a headdress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
All of them wore a chain of shells around their
necks.</p>

<p>She and Cintani were subjected to close inspection
on the part of the women, accompanied by guttural
growls from the men, who would shove the women
aside, now and then, with sweeping blows of the
arm.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the band satisfied, the leader,
who had evidently chosen Sana for his own, picked
her up and carried her into the cave. This was
quite large, one side of the floor being strewn with
the skins of wild animals. On these Sana was
thrown. The savage walked away, but returned and
sat down at her side.</p>

<p>With leering eyes he contemplated her figure,
growling in a fearful manner. Sana could not understand
his words, but shivered as she realized the
meaning of his gestures. He reached over to untie
her feet, but the touch of his rough hands on her
limbs made her desperate. Summoning her strength,
she kicked him in the side.</p>

<p>With what might have been a chuckle, he rose to
his feet and walked to the other end of the cave.
Returning with a club he shook it at the girl and
threw it down at her side. Fearing an attack, Sana,
covering her face with her hands, shrieked pitifully.</p>

<p>The caveman, however, made no attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
touch her, but after looking at her for a time, turned
and left the cave.</p>

<p>Greatly relieved, Sana drew herself up to a sitting
position and looked around the cave. In the gloom
she could see little, but she noticed that on the walls
behind her were drawings of animals, while here and
there were bows and arrows lying among the skins
on the floor.</p>

<p>A sound came to her ears, and looking in the direction
from which it came, she could distinguish in
the gloom of the cavern, a young woman tending a
new-born babe.</p>

<p>The mother paid no attention to Sana, nor was
she disturbed the rest of the day.</p>

<p>With nightfall, however, the whole band entered
the cave, bringing Cintani with them. Cintani was
thrown to the floor at Sana’s side, while the others,
men, women and children, lay down in huddled
heaps to sleep.</p>

<p>Sana’s first words to Cintani were, “Where did
those brutes come from?”</p>

<p>“About a week ago Amshied and his gang, who
luckily were away, when you were there, returned
with them. What he wanted to do with them, I do
not know, but he kept them locked up in a room.
I believe he was afraid of them himself. They must
have escaped in the fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“But what will become of us?”</p>

<p>“I believe I have a way. I had no love for Amshied.
I was sold to him as a slave. One day I
stole a vial of poison, intending to kill myself. My
courage failed me, but ever since that day I have
carried it with me. I have it now. If I ever get the
chance I shall poison them.”</p>

<p>“If you only could. But how could we get away
from here? We would never find our way.”</p>

<p>“But our horses are here. I saw them. They
brought them along too.”</p>

<p>Overjoyed with these words, Sana started to say
something, but was interrupted by the arrival of one
of the men, who taking Cintani in his arms, carried
her to the darkness of the other side of the cave.</p>

<p>Shutting her eyes, Sana put her hands over her
ears to keep out any sound. Suddenly she was
aware of someone at her side. Horrified, she felt
a pair of hands steal over her. Looking, she saw
her captor lying at her side. Without a word he
reached down and released her feet. Again those
hands upon her! With a cry she rolled over on her
face, fearful of her fate. Much to her surprise the
savage, after a few attempts to fondle her, retied
her feet and hitting her some glancing blows, he
shuffled off into the darkness.</p>

<p>Exhausted though she was, Sana lay awake the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
entire night. Fear kept her from sleeping, fear of
what might happen.</p>

<p>At daybreak the savages left the cave, taking Cintani
with them. Sana they did not bother about,
although one of the men stopped to stare at her on
his way out.</p>

<p>Try as she would she could not keep awake any
longer. Sleep came, dreamless sleep!</p>

<p>Someone was shaking her gently. Rousing herself,
Sana looked up. Cintani was bending over her,
smiling happily.</p>

<p>“We are safe now, dear. The poison has done
its work.”</p>

<p>Sana, comforted, yet surprised, “How did you
do it?”</p>

<p>Tears welled in the girl’s eyes as she brokenly
whispered, “After what happened last night I supposed
the women considered me one of them. They
made me help with the food. That gave me my
chance.”</p>

<p>Sana wanted to take the weeping girl in her arms,
but Cintani would not let her.</p>

<p>“There is no time to be lost,” she urged, “Come,
let us get out of this. I have food and water.”</p>

<p>Once out of the cave, Sana saw that Cintani was
right. The cave people were lying on the ground,
apparently asleep, but theirs was an eternal slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>With delighted eyes, Sana saw the two horses.
Quickly the girls mounted and rode off in the clear
moonlight. Sana gave her horse his head, knowing
that his instinct would tell him the way.</p>

<p>All that night their swift mounts put the miles
under their feet. The desert stars, which had
guided Sana, had disappeared and the sun, coming
up from behind the dunes, saw the two girls riding
wildly homeward, till night fell, then they rested
for a few hours. Early in the morning they started
out again.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sana’s horse shied at something lying
on the ground. A man was lying in the sand, face
upward, writhing in the fever of thirst. Dismounting,
Sana saw at a glance it was de Rochelle. He
pleaded for help. At first she was tempted to ride
on and leave him to his fate. But a kindlier thought
prompted her to reach for her canteen which still
hung intact at the saddle.</p>

<p>After administering a little water to the suffering
man, she and Cintani managed to lift him across her
horse and again they resumed their way.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the following day they came
upon the remains of the Berber’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Sana dismounted, looking about for some trace
of Carl, whom she had seen felled with the blow
of the caveman’s club. No sign of him was to be
seen, but she presently became aware of a figure
kneeling before a cross of charred timbers.</p>

<p>She saw it was a woman, and walking quickly
towards her gave voice to the cry, “Mother!”</p>

<p>At the sound the woman took her hands from her
face, and rising to her feet, shrieked, “Sana, my
Sana!”</p>

<p>Mother and daughter embraced each other, tears
in their eyes, murmuring words of endearment.</p>

<p>Sana, at last, eager for news of Carl, asked her
mother whether she had seen or heard of him. In
response the mother pointed to the cross—to which
was pinned a note. Sana, stricken with fear that
Carl was beneath the ruins, rushed to the cross, and
taking the paper in her hand, read:</p>

<p class="center">HERE LIES MY BELOVED<br>
SANA VON SECKT<br>
REST IN PEACE<br>
<span class="gap">CARL</span></p>

<p>“Then he is alive?” turning to her mother with
eager eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, beloved, he is alive. He is now on the
great desert. He thought you dead and came to
tell me. Then he went away.”</p>

<p>De Rochelle, still weak and exhausted, had gotten
from the horse, and came over to Sana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Sana, I did not believe you would ever do me
the kindness you did. Please forgive me for what
I have done. It was I who set fire to this place. I
realized that harm might come to you through Amshied,
so I set fire to the house, thinking I could help
you in that way. I saw the savages take you away,
and tried to follow, but fell exhausted. Please, forgive
me, Sana, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Without a word Sana turned away. Plead he
might, but her forgiveness he would never have.
The water she gave him on the desert, she felt, repaid
him well enough—had she refused it, he would
now have been claimed by the sun and the sand as
their own. And in her woman’s mind she knew that
he had more to do with the escapade at the home of
Amshied than he cared to tell.</p>

<p>Safe at home that night she wrote Carl at his
New York address, telling him that she was alive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

ON CAMEL’S BACK THROUGH THE
SAHARA</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE at sunrise on the day of
his departure, Carl had gone to the market
place to join the caravan. Among
the crowd that gathered there, at the very time the
caravan set out, he found Sana’s mother, who had
come to bid him goodbye.</p>

<p>From one of the tourists he learned that the caravan
would lead over Tandini and Tenduf to Mogador
in Morocco. This, he recalled, was the route
followed by the crusaders of Islam, when they wandered
through the desert lands, to preach Mohammedism
with fire and sword.</p>

<p>The caravan itself consisted of some twenty-five
racing camels, the true ships of the desert, capable
of making from sixty to eighty miles a day. Besides
these there were four freight camels, each loaded
with about four hundred pounds of food and water,
the latter being especially important, as for days
they would not pass any wells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Carl had noted with a smile that the tourists as
well as the guides were dressed in Berber outfits;
wide skirts and the gaily striped burnus, with its big
collar. He saw, too, that there were several French
officers in uniform in the party.</p>

<p>Like himself, everyone in the party was well
armed. The guides, as well as some of the tourists,
were provided with bandoliers of cartridges and carried
rifles, while he noticed several of the others, not
so visibly equipped, adjust cartridge belts and holsters.
Taking the hint, he saw to it that his own
automatic was fully loaded and his spare clips readily
accessible.</p>

<p>Such precautions were necessary, of course, to
enable them to repulse the attacks of any wild animals
that, through pangs of hunger, might become
daring enough to attack the travelers. To be
dreaded, too, were the attacks of the bandits roving
the sand hills. The chieftains of the larger bandit
tribes had already received the regular tribute from
the famous sheik Tan Jajidani, who in turn would
be doubly paid by the wealthy merchant who furnished
the camel and ran the show. While these
would be satisfied to let the caravan in peace, there
might be others not so inclined.</p>

<p>At last, with a great hullabaloo, the caravan was
under way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>At first Carl experienced much discomfort, but he
found that by relaxing and allowing his body to
sway with the jogging steps of the camel, it wasn’t
as bad as he had expected.</p>

<p>Far ahead of the caravan rode two guides, whose
duty it was to lead the way, and at the same time
keep a sharp watch for unfriendly visitors.</p>

<p>Long before the main body of travelers would
reach a village or camp, the inhabitants would
swarm out to meet them, offering fruit or drink for
sale, while at friendly camps water was offered to
everyone. To refuse to drink was considered an
unfriendly act, and the guides cautioned all to be
sure to partake of the hospitality.</p>

<p>Otherwise the journey that day was uneventful.
There was nothing, outside of a few tiny camps or
villages, to greet the eye but sand, desert sand.</p>

<p>Tents were pitched that night under the desert
stars. The campfire gave forth a grateful warmth,
for the night air was bitter cold. Carl was sorry
that he was not outfitted with a woolen burnus, but
knowing he would have to be up at daybreak, was
soon comfortable between his blankets.</p>

<p>With the first rays of the sun peeping over the
horizon, the caravan broke camp. Carl was amazed
at the speed with which the camels were saddled or
loaded, the tents folded away, and the caravan gotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
on its way, accompanied by the singing of the
guides and the jingle of the lead-camel’s bells.</p>

<p>Thinking of Sana, he recalled of the manuscript
he had taken with him.</p>

<p>He would have the whole day to himself, with
nothing to do, so he took it from his pocket to read.
The manuscript, written in a careful hand, was entitled,
“The Conception of Our Universe.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two hundred years before Christ, the great mathematician
Archimedes said, “Give me a fulcrum and
I will move the earth!”</p>

<p>Our earth is a huge ball, about eight thousand
miles in diameter and it weighs some six hundred
trillion or sextillion tons. (To remember this place
twenty-one ciphers after the six—6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.)
It is composed of rock, sand
and water. Seventy-three per cent., or about three-quarters,
of the earth is water—the balance, twenty-seven
per cent., or about one-quarter, is solid matter,
that is, rock or sand.</p>

<p>The entire surface of the earth measures nearly
two hundred million square miles and in contents
the earth is about two hundred and sixty billion cubic
miles.</p>

<p>The earth is covered with a thin envelope of air
and clouds which travels with the earth. If such was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
not the case, a balloon rising in Europe could stay
up three hours, and without moving from its position,
land in North America. Furthermore, if the
air blanket did not travel with the earth, it is probable
that the earth would burn up, since the friction
between the earth’s surface and the air would develop
great heat, a heat in which nothing could live.</p>

<p>The earth traveling in a magnetic field like that of
a huge dynamo, speeds around its own imaginary
axis, which lies at an angle of 23½ degrees, once in
twenty-four hours. This is at a speed, when one
stands at the Equator, say in North Africa, of more
than a thousand miles per hour, whereas a few feet
from the poles, the speed is not more than nineteen
feet in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>As it whirls around itself, the earth rushes
through space in orbital motion, in an easterly direction
around the sun, at a velocity of eighteen and a
half miles per second, or six hundred and sixty-six
thousand miles per hour, a speed that is about fifty
times as great as that of the swiftest cannon ball.
We earth people are entirely unconscious of this motion,
since it is perfectly steady and without a jar.</p>

<p>Once in a year, that is in a little more than three
hundred and sixty-five days, we travel around the
sun, but remain away from that planet at a distance
of about ninety-two million miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>As we look upward at the sky at night we see, in
all directions, the countless stars. Most pronounced
among them and looking much the same, though of
a different nature, are the planets and once in a while
a comet. A few faintly shining clouds are seen—the
Milky Way and Nebulae.</p>

<p>The most striking, and yet the most insignificant
of them all is the moon.</p>

<p>During that period known as “day” to us the sun
alone is visible, flooding the air with its light and
thereby hiding all other heavenly bodies from the
vision of the unaided eye—a few of them being
visible through a telescope.</p>

<p>These heavenly bodies, for the most part, are
globes like the earth. They whirl on their axes and
move swiftly through space. They are classified as
the solar system, made up of the sun, the planets
which move round the sun and the satellites, which,
in turn, attend the planets in their motion around
the sun. Thus the moon attends the earth when the
earth travels around the sun.</p>

<p>The sun, ninety-two million miles away from the
earth, is a hot self-luminous globe, with a diameter
of eight hundred and sixty-six thousand five hundred
miles, or one hundred nine and one-half times that
of the earth. The temperature at the sun surface
has been calculated to range between ten and fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
thousand degrees Fahrenheit—a heat we cannot
conceive.</p>

<p>Unlike the earth and the other planets, the sun,
the center of our universe, is stationary; but it rotates
on its own axis, inclined at seven and one-quarter
degrees, once in twenty-seven and a half days.
This motion has been established by observing the
sun spots.</p>

<p>These sun spots vary in size from five hundred to
fifty thousand miles in diameter and a group of such
spots was found to be one hundred and fifty thousand
miles across. They are short-lived phenomena,
sometimes remaining only a few days but frequently
a month or two. They appear in their greatest magnitude
at periods of eleven years and are the cause
of extreme drought on earth, with its resultant destruction
of crops and vegetation, and consequent
famines.</p>

<p>While until recently it was believed that the sun
spots were eruptions on the sun, some astronomers
now claim that, as the sun spots are cooler than the
sun, they indicate the downpour of meteoric showers
thrown by Jupiter and Saturn into the sun,
thereby increasing the heat radiating from the sun.</p>

<p>The sun spots manifest themselves in world-wide
heat waves, earthquakes, tidal waves, cloud bursts,
floods, waterspouts, hailstorms and hurricanes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
many widely separated parts of the earth. History
has never seen the equal of the destruction caused
by the last phenomena. A glance at a few of the recent
disasters and natural phenomena shows the
following:</p>

<p>The volcanoes Villarion, Liaima and Lanin
spouted flames more than a thousand feet from their
craters, while the activities of other volcanoes killed
thousands of people. Six new craters opened in
Mount Isalco, Salvador; the volcano Kilauea in
Hawaii spouted mountains of lava, which darkened
the sky and earthquakes shook many parts of the
earth. During the last three thousand years thirteen
million people have met their deaths by volcano
and earthquake.</p>

<p>Cyclones, hailstorms and floods wiped out many
towns in various parts of the world; in Pueblo alone
they caused damage aggregating more than ten million
dollars. Many lives were lost in waterspouts,
which destroyed part of Tangier, Morocco, and in
the Maia-Doura province in Spain.</p>

<p>Heat caused the glaciers of the Alps to melt and
move at an alarming speed, while lakes in Switzerland
dried up, exposing their bottoms and showing
foundations of the homes of the lake-dwellers living
there thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>While the sun is the nearest of the stars, the moon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
is the nearest of the heavenly bodies. It is about
two hundred and forty thousand miles from the
earth and has a diameter of about twenty-two hundred
miles, or about one-quarter that of the earth.
The moon, accompanying the earth in its movement
around the sun, rotates on its axis once in twenty-nine
and a half days and moves in a small orbit, once
in twenty-seven and a third days, around the earth
at a speed of nearly twenty-three hundred miles per
hour. The moon shines merely by reflected light
from the sun, whose light is six hundred thousand
times brighter than that of the moon. The moon
has a temperature of two hundred degrees below
zero, Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The surface of the moon structure, for the most
part, is extremely broken. There are hills or mountains,
but the surface is pitted all over with great
“craters,” ranging from fifty to one hundred miles
in diameter; there being a few with a diameter of
more than one thousand miles. A counterpart of
this is hardly to be found on our earth, yet it is believed
that the moon was once part of this earth,
becoming separated from the parent body by the
tremendous centrifugal force of the earth; as it is
likewise assumed that Jupiter will in time throw off
its “great red spot” thus forming a new moon of
Jupiter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>It is believed that the planet Mars, which has
two moons, is inhabited and that it has great irrigation
canals, which engineers say are far superior
to any irrigation system on earth. During the last
sun spot period wireless signals were supposed to
have been received from Mars.</p>

<p>From time to time, bodies very different from the
stars and planets appear in the heavens, remaining
visible for some weeks or months and then vanish
in the distance. These are the comets. The larger
ones are magnificent objects, sometimes as bright as
Venus and visible by day, with a head as large as
the moon and having a train or tail extending behind
it from the horizon to the zenith and which is in
reality long enough to reach from the earth to the
sun.</p>

<p>Such comets, however, are rare, and in ancient and
medieval times comets were always regarded with
terror—as an evil omen—and at times the people
believed that they foretold the end of the world,
causing veritable panics, like the “comet scare” of
France in 1832. As a rule these comets reappear
at intervals, such as do Halley’s, Euke’s and Donati’s
comets. They travel at a tremendous speed,
coming at times quite close to the earth. Quite often
they cross the path of the earth, causing fear that
a collision might take place. There are a few isolated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
cases of comets colliding with the earth and
killing a few people. Some of the comets have been
lost, that is we do not know what became of them.
Such a lost wanderer of the skies is Biela’s comet;
a comet of some forty thousand miles diameter. In
its appearances, every sixth and sixteenth year, its
course would come within a few thousand miles of
the earth’s orbit.</p>

<p>Besides the luminous clouds we see in the heavens
and which, under the telescope are shown to be but
great groups of separate stars, there are others
which no telescopic power has as yet been able to disclose
individually. These are known as nebulae and
are of varying shape and form and very beautiful
in appearance.</p>

<p>Once in a while the earth passes through such a
nebulae. Some years ago the Heidelberg Observatory
reported that the earth was passing through
some such nebulae, which report was confirmed by
various other observatories. In that case there was
no noticeable effect on human life, but it is believed
by astronomers that some of these nebulae are composed
of strong poisonous gases and that if ever the
earth passes through such a nebulae all life on this
planet will be destroyed.</p>

<p>Occasionally bodies fall upon the earth out of the
sky. These are the meteors. They are not noticeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
until they come within our air zone, when the
friction between them and the air causes them to
become red hot, often being entirely consumed by
the heat before reaching the earth itself. They
travel through the air zone at a speed ranging from
ten to forty miles per second, accompanied by a
heavy continuous roar, emphasized now and then by
violent detonations. These meteors are solid bodies;
containing a large percentage of iron and copper and
single pieces have been found to weigh as much as
seventy-five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>It is believed that these meteors are fragments
which, ages ago, were shot out from now extinct
volcanoes, with so great a velocity that they were
thrown out beyond the attraction of the earth, and
so becoming individual planets or heavenly bodies
for the time being. Such being the case, they have
traveled in independent orbits, until they at last encountered
the earth at a point where her orbit
crosses theirs. It may also be possible that these
meteors were thrown from the planets or the stars,
and as meteoric showers occur at intervals of thirty-three
to thirty-four years, it is often believed that
they are connected with comets and that therefore
the comets, too, must be solid bodies like our earth.
The number of meteors falling upon the earth adds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
continuously to the earth’s mass at a rate of about
forty thousand tons per year.</p>

<p>Our earth is older than five hundred million years,
according to Prof. Morean of Bourges Observatory,
France, who holds that for half of that time, two
hundred and fifty million years, some form of life
has existed on its surface. Man, however, can
boast of only some ten thousand years of ancestry
in direct lines. In other words, in the life of this
little globe he is, even in his most primitive form, a
very recent arrival.</p>

<p>The earth was once a hot gaseous mass like the
sun. Gradually the surface cooled, condensation
took place forming the lakes and seas and after a
great period of time vegetation appeared.</p>

<p>Water, entering the bowels of the earth, through
cracks or some such opening in the surface, would
evaporate into steam and under high pressure break
through the earth crust and create a volcano, carrying
with it great masses of molten rock. The hot
geysers of Yellowstone Park, in America, are similar
examples of such internal action.</p>

<p>In historic times there were lakes in the Sahara
Desert and the so-called “Hopeless Desert” lying in
the Rocky Mountains of North America, while in
the Sierra Nevadas there was a time, not more than
a million years ago, when all of the territory was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
well watered and vegetated. One of these lakes, in
western Utah and extending over into Nevada, was
one hundred and seventy-five miles wide, two hundred
and fifty miles long and in places over a thousand
feet in depth. Other evidences of this phenomenon,
of tremendous masses of water entering
into the bowels of the earth, are found particularly
in the many caves among the Pyrenees and in the
Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, the largest cavern in
the world, in the upper galleries of which can still
be seen the perforations through which the waters
descended.</p>

<p>As we descend into the earth we observe an increase
in temperature of one degree Fahrenheit for
every fifty feet. At a depth of ten or twelve miles
the earth is red hot. At a depth of a hundred miles
the temperature is so great that if at the surface of
the earth it would liquefy all solid matter.</p>

<p>Not only lakes and seas have disappeared, but
whole continents, in much more peculiar ways.
Where the Atlantic Ocean now lies, there was once,
some four million years ago, a continent which we
call “Atlantis,” connecting America with Africa, and
believed to have been peopled with a race far more
intelligent than any now existing upon the earth.
They were one-eyed and had conquered the laws of
nature; their airships flying by natural forces, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
as do our sailboats. Their animals could speak and
had great destructive powers. But this can be only
hearsay, since now “Atlantis” lies at the bottom of
the ocean, gone forever, like many mountains which
have likewise gone down into the waters.</p>

<p>These surface changes, together with internal disturbances,
created a wandering polar system and
bodily displacement of both poles took place. With
this came a great change in the climate of the earth.
The lands of the present equator, which, only some
twenty thousand years ago, were as cold as our present
arctic zones, became tropical in climate, while
the flourishing lands at the north and south poles
grew desolate and cold, as they are today. The
pole-axis of the earth has since changed considerably—Europe,
only some twelve thousand years
ago being covered with a great ice sheet.</p>

<p>The highest peak of the earth is Mount Everest,
twenty-nine thousand feet above sea level, and the
greatest depth of the sea is more than twenty-five
thousand feet. Some of the earth’s surface lies below
sea level, but it is not flooded on account of being
surrounded by mountain ranges. A great part
of the Sahara, for instance, is below sea level. The
Sahara, less inhabited than any other area of the
earth, covers one-twelfth part of the land surface of
the earth, having an area of some four million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
square miles. It is by no means all sand; there are
some plateaus and oases. In the days of Julius
Caesar it was a fertile, well cultivated land, and was
known as the “Granary of the Roman Empire.”
With the fall of the old Roman Empire, however,
the desert was neglected and the sands swallowed
up the fertile lands.</p>

<p>Scientists and explorers have dreamed for generations
of schemes not only to cultivate the desert,
but to put such fertile lands within the reach of industry.
It is estimated that the Sahara could easily
support a population of two hundred million souls
and in addition supply Europe with all her fruit,
vegetables, cereals and cotton, in fact with all products
that are at present produced in North America.</p>

<p>The government of France, some fifty years ago,
wanted to build a fifty-mile canal and let the waters
of the ocean flow in to submerge and flood a great
part of the Sahara, so as to change the climate and
produce vegetation. Such a plan, however, would
not only change the climate of the Sahara, but would
change the climates of all the countries of the entire
world, with dire consequences, and to such an extent
that the end of the world would be believed near.</p>

<p>As it concerns our world it is something in which
every individual should be interested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Let us have a look at the paradox of our universe
or rather the theories of our astronomers.</p>

<p>The astronomers contend that our earth was millions
of years in the process of evolution and that
man has been on the earth but a comparatively short
time. Religion tells us that the earth, seas, sun,
moon and stars were all created in six days of
twenty-four hours each. Which is right?</p>

<p>If the earth is a globe with a curvature of twenty-four
feet in every six miles, how is it that the Mississippi
River starting as it does, at a low level,
travels at an incline and toward the equator, the
largest diameter of the earth; that is traveling uphill
and reaches the sea after twenty-seven hundred
miles. Do astronomers overlook this fact?</p>

<p>Astronomers contend that our earth spins around
an imaginary axis—a ball weighing six hundred trillion
tons, and eight thousand miles in diameter
spinning around an imaginary axis! What gave the
earth the original momentum five hundred million
years ago, and what keeps it up? Did the speed
of the earth increase or decrease with the evolution
of the earth?</p>

<p>These same men of high learning say that the
earth, composed of rock, sand and water, travels
at the equator at a speed of more than one thousand
miles per hour or one hundred and fifty thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
feet per second. Yet any engineer knows that a
spinning flywheel of solid iron will fly apart at a
speed of from twenty to thirty thousand feet per
second. By what power, then, is the earth held
together?</p>

<p>Then again they say that the lands at the north
and south poles spin around like a merry-go-round.
Did the men who discovered the poles make any
report of being made sea-sick?</p>

<p>If the sun is stationary and the earth moves
around it, how could Joshua have commanded the
sun to stand still and was obeyed, as the Bible says?</p>

<p>If the moon, as the astronomers contend, is a
body thrown from the earth by centrifugal force,
while the earth was still in a semi-fluid state, why
was it thrown just that distance, two hundred and
forty thousand miles, no further or no less; why did
it then change its course and float in empty space,
ever since accompanying the earth in its travels
around the sun?</p>

<p>What becomes of the ocean waters at the high
point of the equator? Do they flow by gravity,
like the waters of a stream, toward the lower levels,
the north and south poles? Who and what holds
that water in place between the poles and the equator?
Take a rough surfaced metal ball upon a
spindle and speed it up to a surface speed of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
thousand miles per hour, let us say; charge it with
electricity as the earth is said to be charged, then
pour water on the spinning ball. Will it adhere
to the ball or does the centrifugal force throw it
off in all directions?</p>

<p>If standing water has not a uniform level, let our
astronomers build a tank, several miles long, such
as the watering channels used by the railroads.
Would the level of this standing water be higher
at one end than at the other?</p>

<p>Or was Copernicus wrong as well as all other
astronomers who blindly believe in him, like they
blindly followed the theory of gravity until another
came along and told us we were all wrong?</p>

<p>We believed, for years, that we could locate a
star in a fixed position. Now we are told by Einstein
that it cannot be done because the rays of the
stars are bent when passing through the gravitational
field of the sun.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the seemingly contradictory
theories of our universe, which speculative
science would have the unsophisticated public believe.</p>

<p>I often ask myself, is the universe a huge Fata
Morgana, covered by a veil no mortal shall ever
lift?</p>

<p>Truly the guesses of one generation are but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
amusements of another. If it were possible to
cruise the distant heavens some startling facts would
no doubt be revealed. As yet it is all a dream.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Finishing the article, Carl folded it and put it
away. To himself, half aloud he muttered, “Whew!
That sets one to thinking. This is something I have
been looking for for a long time—the universe in
a nutshell. Too bad he didn’t live to finish and
publish it. It would have given the world something
to talk about.”</p>

<p>Once more his thoughts went to his beloved.
“Poor Sana,” he murmured, “I miss you so. Just
when my hopes were highest, just when the future
looked its rosiest, you had to be taken away from
me. Two days of happiness and then all is misery.
Like a vision you came and went.”</p>

<p>His head bowed, he rode on in silence. Sana
had been very dear to him and the hurt was great.</p>

<p>Suddenly, shots ringing clear in the desert air,
roused him from his dreams. From behind a large
sand hill rode a band of Arabs, shaking their rifles
and crying loudly.</p>

<p>The caravan halted, and the travelers made haste
to return the fire of the bandits. Unslinging his
automatic Carl accounted for two of the attackers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
while some of the others fell before the rifles of the
guides and the army officers.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few minutes. The bandits,
outnumbered two to one, rode off leaving half their
number behind, dead or badly wounded.</p>

<p>Fortunately the caravan suffered little. One of
the camels had been killed, while one of the travelers,
an elderly Englishman, suffered a slight wound in
the arm. This was immediately treated by one of
the guides, and after the excitement had died down,
the caravan again set out across the desert.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

THE LOVER’S DREAM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAY after day the caravan moved slowly
on, under the blazing sun of the desert.</p>

<p>One day was much like the other, just
sand and sun, sun and sand. Days of intense heat,
nights of extreme cold!</p>

<p>It was getting too monotonous for Carl. Inaction
of body allowed too great a freedom of mind.
His days and nights were filled with thoughts of
Sana, thoughts that became maddening as he realized
the futility of life. Thoughts which made him
more and more morose as the days went by.</p>

<p>Only once did he show a mutual interest in the
things that occurred about him. That was when
one of the travelers called his attention to a beautiful
oasis nearby, to which, however, the guides paid
not the slightest attention. Questioned as to why
the caravan did not stop, the guides replied to the
effect that this was but a mirage of the Gurara
Oasis, some five hundred miles away.</p>

<p>For a few minutes they watched it, shimmering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
in the sunlight. Then it was gone as quickly as it
had appeared.</p>

<p>“Fata Morgana,” mused Carl, “Life and it are
the same—just an illusion.”</p>

<p>That night they reached Tenduf, having placed
a thousand miles of desert behind them.</p>

<p>The following day they reached the sand-hill region
of Igidi. Here the desert looked as if on
fire. The sands glowed red beneath the blazing sun.
In the distance one could see great whirling clouds
of sand, rising hundreds of feet in the air.</p>

<p>The caravan halted. For a time it looked as if
the storm would pass in another direction. Suddenly,
however, it was upon them. The sky was
darkened with the flying sand, the very ground itself
seemed to be shifting under the fury of the storm.</p>

<p>Instinctively the camels had lowered themselves
to the ground. The travelers, under the direction
of the guides, quickly threw themselves on the sands
alongside of their beasts, covering themselves as best
they could with their cloaks.</p>

<p>For two long hours the storm raged—hours that
seemed eternity to the suffocating men. Try as they
would, they could not keep the dustlike sand from
entering their eyes, nose and mouth. It was necessary,
too, that they rise up for a minute or two to
keep from being sanded in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_203">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_203.jpg" alt="The travelers threw themselves on
the shifting sand">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">The sky was darkened with the sand storm; instinctively the
camels lowered themselves and the travelers threw themselves on
the shifting sand, alongside of their beasts.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>At last the storm was spent and the air once more
fit to breathe. Man and beast stood up, shaking
off their burdens of sand, to resume their journey.
But thirty miles had been covered so far that day
and they faced twenty more miles before they could
rest.</p>

<p>Carl was worn out. The storm and his general
indisposition had got the better of him. It was with
difficulty that he mounted his camel, and once up,
it was harder still for him to keep awake.</p>

<p>For a time he struggled with the desire to sleep,
but it was useless.</p>

<p>Gone now was the caravan, gone the desert!
Sana and he were in a huge aeroplane. It was their
first flight together in the “Meteor,” as he had
named it. Long had he worked to perfect this
machine. Nothing similar had ever before been devised.
Its large bullet-shaped body and spreading
wings gave it the appearance of a gigantic bird. It
flew without an engine, propelled by an invisible
force, the secret of which was his, alighting and
soaring at will, through wind or calm. It would
hover in the air like a hawk and at the pressure
of his hand on a lever would rush through space at
an unlimited speed. He had gotten a thousand miles
an hour out of it, but that was nothing compared
to what it could do!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>Below them lay what was once the great Sahara
Desert. But how different now! The great canal
had been dug and the waters of the sea let in but
a short year before. Already the country had
changed—great fertile fields had sprung up on all
sides. Gone were the sand hills—gone too, Sana
cried, was her Gurara Oasis.</p>

<p>Swinging southward they soon passed over the
great jungles of Africa. Here, too, a mighty change
had been wrought. The tropical climate had gone,
the jungle life was dying. Ice was forming on some
of the swamps. Strange beasts were wandering
about aimlessly, seeking a warmer land. Among
these were animals of which modern man knew little
or nothing—the unicorn for instance, an animal existing
only in the imagination of writers and artists,
or as Carl noted, through his powerful field glasses,
a monstrous dinosaur, walking on its high legs. He
had seen many skeletons of that primitive beast in
museums all over the world, but he had believed,
with the rest of the world, that no such animal existed
in modern times. Yet here it was, driven from
its jungle haunts by the ever increasing cold. The
natives, too, he saw bewildered and afraid—huddled
close to their fires, filled with wonder and dismay.</p>

<p>In Europe they found similar climatic changes.
It was July, but everywhere the people were wearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
their heaviest clothing to keep warm. The vegetation
of the land was being slowly but surely destroyed
by the terrible frosts. People were dying
by millions because of the lack of food and the diseases
that swept the land.</p>

<p>Forgotten were the hatreds of war—forgotten
the enmities of society. Nations were striving with
each other to maintain life. In Germany Carl
found the entire resources devoted to the manufacture
and distribution of a chemical preparation
which was to take the place of food for the Germans
and other peoples of Europe.</p>

<p>Throughout Europe all communication by wireless,
by telegraph or telephone was halted. This
was caused by the continual display of the so-called
“Northern Lights,” now of much greater intensity
in Europe than ever witnessed before even at the
North Pole.</p>

<p>In a flight over the Arctic regions they saw the
great ice flows break up and drift southward, exposing
land that had never been known to exist.</p>

<p>Volcanoes, long thought to have been extinct, suddenly
came to life, belching forth numerous pillars
of ashes, smoke and molten lava. On the western
coast of North America a great earthquake took
place, throwing up a range of mountains thousands
of feet high, accompanied by untold loss of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
and property. So frequent and great were the
earthquakes that shook the globe that it was feared
by the learned men the world over that the world
would be literally shattered to pieces. Large bodies
of water, which had accumulated in the Sahara,
seeped through the dry sand into the hot bowels of
the earth, where the water was converted into steam
and under high pressure caused the eruption and
explosion of numerous volcanoes.</p>

<p>Ocean steamers fortunate enough to avoid the
great icebergs that were daily gathering their toll
of life or the terrible waterspouts that occurred in
every part of the sea would not respond to the compass.
Their masters reported that the needles
pointed far away from what had been north. The
earth had been thrown out of balance! This explained
to some extent the change of climate the
world over. Lands that had been in equatorial regions
were thrown north or south with regard to
their position in relation to the sun.</p>

<p>The saying of Archimedes, “Give me a fulcrum
and I will move the earth,” had come true. But
instead of a lever and fulcrum, a counter ballast of
water, flooding the Sahara, had done the work.</p>

<p>Scientists began to speculate as to the course the
earth would follow in its yearly movement around
the sun. By comparative astronomical measurements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
it was established that the earth was following
a path greatly deflected from its former orbit, while
other planets flouted the rules as to orbits and behaved
more like comets. Would the earth now
collide with other planets, was the question on everyone’s
lips. All the fixed “rules of thumb” the
astronomers used had to be discarded for new calculations
and guesswork.</p>

<p>And the earth was traveling through unknown
space at a speed of six hundred and sixty-six thousand
miles an hour!</p>

<p>Then came the age of darkness! The millions of
tons of dust and ashes thrown into the heavens from
the hundreds of erupting volcanoes, traveling with
the winds of the earth, formed a heavy film through
which the rays of the sun could barely penetrate.
The air grew cold; blizzards were ever more frequent
and severe; gradually the earth was sheathed
in a covering of ice.</p>

<p>But through the darkness there came a light,
growing brighter and brighter as the days went by.</p>

<p>Astronomers reported that this strange light came
from an unknown comet traveling at great speed
toward the earth. As time passed the entire horizon
was illuminated by this strange visitor. The light
became brighter and more intense than that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
hottest sun. And nearer and nearer it came to the
earth!</p>

<p>All over the world anxious eyes watched the
comet night and day. Was the end of the world at
hand? The most irreligious people spent days and
nights in prayer. Nations set prayer-days to save
the world from destruction. People lost their reason
and wandered around helplessly and aimlessly, until
maddened entirely they took their lives.</p>

<p>A poisonous gas swept over the face of the earth.
Chemists and scientists alike were baffled in their
attempts to analyze it. Was it caused by the passing
of the world through one of the nebulae, which long
had been regarded as composed of dangerous gases?
Or could it be that the comet now speeding toward
them was discharging these gases? They could find
no answer.</p>

<p>But whatever it was, it was taking fearful toll on
earth. Never had anything like it been witnessed
before. Men dropped dead in the streets. Women,
their babes at their breasts, died in their homes.
The open air was no longer safe. Even the houses
were penetrated regardless of what precautions were
taken to stop up crevices in doors and windows.</p>

<p>Life on earth was unbearable!</p>

<p>Carl, disgusted with the miserable condition, determined,
then, that he and his wife, Sana, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
leave the now inhospitable earth and seek a haven
of refuge on some other planet.</p>

<p>It was but a matter of hours to make arrangements.
A generous supply of the artificial food was
put into the machine. They did not have to worry
about fuel, as the “Meteor” would generate its
mysterious power as it traveled. Carl had explained
this to Sana, confidentially. Fuel for the engines,
if such the delicate apparatus might be called, was
secured directly from the atmosphere. The higher
the speed of the plane the more rarefied the atmosphere,
the better the quality of fuel. Furthermore,
Carl did not have to attend any steering devices.
The plane traveled in an electric wave zone, driven
forward by this new device, and once headed in any
desired direction would continue in that direction
indefinitely.</p>

<p>Helping Sana into the enclosed body of the
“Meteor,” Carl bade farewell to the earth. Soon
they were speeding heavenward at a tremendous
pace, going in the direction of the earth’s rotation.</p>

<p>Looking out of the port-hole-like windows of the
plane Carl and Sana saw that they had already
passed through the dust cloud which enveloped the
earth. As they watched, they saw the earth and
moon whiz past them with the speed of falling
comets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>From this time on their mentality was severed
from that of the peoples of the earth. They were
independent of the conception of time, which, really,
exists only in the minds of the human race, according
to Einstein’s theory.</p>

<p>An unusual sight now presented itself to the flying
couple. The great comet that had caused so much
consternation on earth was in plain view. Behind
the tremendous sun-like head trailed a most imposing
tail, millions of miles in length, and from all appearances
composed of gases and without any sharp lines
of demarkation. This tail had not been visible to
the watchers on earth because of the great dust
cloud. To Carl and Sana, however, it was quite
distinct, looking much like a great inverted comma,
imprinted on the endless depths of the sky.</p>

<p>It was necessary for Carl, after a while, to go
to the pressure chambers to replenish the air supply
of their cabin. This done, he idly fingered the
tuning dials of the wireless apparatus with which the
plane was equipped. To his surprise the cabin was
filled with the sound of incoming messages. He
endeavored to interpret them but they were in a
language unknown to him. Somewhere out in the
ether there existed people, he realized, of an intelligence
far greater than that of the earth-men.</p>

<p>Tuning down the wireless, he returned to Sana,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
who was again peering through the windows of the
plane at the myriads of stars that went flashing by.</p>

<p>Now a great planet came into view. Carl recognized
Saturn, 750 times the size of the earth.
Around it traveled a broad concentric ring. It was
accompanied by ten moons.</p>

<p>They kept up their wild flight, passing, after some
days—according to Carl’s watch, at a great distance,
Uranus. In the distance they observed Neptune and
realizing that upon reaching it, they would be some
three billion miles from home, so they decided to
turn homeward. With a great sweep taking several
days the “Meteor” shot around Neptune, and again
after two weeks they passed Uranus and Saturn.
After a while the great planet Jupiter passed them,
or rather they passed the planet, although flying at
their terrific speed they were unconscious of motion.</p>

<p>In the distance loomed up the Milky Way, comprised
as they saw, of billions of stars closely
grouped together. Not wishing to encounter any of
these stars, Carl swung the plane in a wide detour.</p>

<p>This danger passed, the plane hummed along for a
few hours, when Carl, looking downward, saw beneath
them the planet Mars. Throttling down their speed
they hung suspended above that planet at a few miles
height. From their position they could see the great
canal systems which brought the waters from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
snow and ice clad polar regions to the more temperate
zones. These zones, they saw, were covered
with large areas of vegetation, nesting among which
were what appeared to be cities. Above these cities
flew countless airplanes, not so very much different
in appearance from those used on earth.</p>

<p>With “Let us land here,” Carl guided the
“Meteor” Mars-ward, landing shortly in a field covered
with moss and strange plants.</p>

<p>Immediately their plane was surrounded by a host
of strange people. In form they were very much
like the people of the earth. They were, however,
much smaller and had heads large out of all proportion
to their bodies. Clothes too, were not to
be seen.</p>

<p>Before they left the plane Carl warned Sana to
be very careful how she moved about. As Mars
is only one tenth the size of the earth in volume,
gravitation is likewise less. Carl who, on earth
weighed about one hundred and sixty pounds, would
weigh but sixty-four or five pounds on Mars. He
told Sana, jokingly, that she could easily step over
their huge airplane, while a Martian would break
his neck if he tried to jump over an ordinary soap
box.</p>

<p>To the Martians, Sana and Carl must have appeared
quite strange, both as to size and clothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
For a time the crowd stood at a distance as if in
awe of these strange beings that had come to them
out of the skies. At length, however, one of the
group stepped forward and spoke. Much to his
surprise Carl realized that he understood him perfectly.
And stranger, still, Carl found himself answering
in a language that was new to his ears.</p>

<p>Courteously they questioned him as to his desires,
and being informed that Carl and Sana had flown
through space from the earth, their amazement was
without bounds. Would more follow him, they
asked, to which Carl was quick to reply that none
would come. Realizing their doubt, he assured
them that he alone knew the secret of his flight and
that no other earth-men could make the journey.</p>

<p>Assured at last, that these two visitors had come
without intent to harm, they led Carl and Sana to
a great hall, where food and drink were served
them. Food and drink such as they had never tasted
before! The various dishes of chemical food had
the same brown granular appearance, but when
placed in the mouth each gave a different taste and
had different satisfying qualities. The same applied
to the drinks. One could not be distinguished from
the other, either in appearance or odor, yet each was
distinctly different to the palate.</p>

<p>The hall or room and its furnishings, they noted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
were very much like those of the earth. While this
was indeed strange, Carl reasoned that there was
no good reason why two worlds of people, although
separated by untold miles, should not conceive things
along the same lines.</p>

<p>Having eaten, Carl and Sana were informed that
they could come and go as they pleased among the
people of Mars. Whatever they wished was theirs
for the asking—as was the case with all Martians.</p>

<p>This promise of freedom proved well founded.
Together Carl and Sana studied and explored without
interference, although they soon realized that
their every move was witnessed by some Martian or
other.</p>

<p>Life on Mars, they found to be Utopian in the
fullest sense of the word, compared to which the
democracies of the earth were naught but the greatest
farces. Mars, of course, was a much older
world compared with the earth, so far as human
life was concerned and naturally greater things could
have been accomplished.</p>

<p>Here on Mars each individual was accountable
to his neighbor for a certain amount of work; every
man, woman and child had some one thing to do,
and did it willingly.</p>

<p>They had long realized that upon the proper
application of scientific knowledge depended the welfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
of their civilization. Science was their God,
and they worshiped it as we do our Creator!</p>

<p>Most marvelous of the many wonderful things
the two earth people encountered on every hand was
the application of wireless to many walks of life.
Every Martian carried a small and delicate receiving
set with him. No matter where he was he was
always equipped and ready for whatever message
might be sent him. Numerous stations were continually
broadcasting the news of the day. No
papers were needed; in fact the written language
had been discarded long ago as an obsolete thing.
There were no schools, churches, or meeting halls
such as we have on earth. The people sat in their
homes and were informed of all there was to know.</p>

<p>Transportation, too, differed greatly from that of
the earth. All the railways were underground, and
instead of tracks and wheeled cars, such as we have,
cylindrical tubes were shot forward like pistons in
a cylinder, or rather these cylinder-like cars were
sucked from one station to another, at a terrific
speed, by means of great solenoids, the electrical
current for which was secured from the numerous
hydro-electric generating stations that dotted the
banks of the canals, which served the Martians a
double purpose. They furnished the water needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
to irrigate the fields and at the same time ran the
generating plants.</p>

<p>Carl was forcibly struck by the ingenuity displayed
in the utilizing of these canal waters. The waters
used at one station, after being discharged, were
carried along for a short distance, until, through a
series of steps it fell to a lower level, to again be
used by a generating station. It was only after it
had served its purpose of generating power that the
water was finally pumped over the fields. The fields
ran along both sides of the canals for thousands of
miles and averaged perhaps fifteen miles in width.
He saw, too, that while most of the canals ran
parallel with each other, there were some that
crossed each other at different elevations.</p>

<p>Very little labor was performed by hand. Practically
all the work on Mars was done by electrical
machinery, devised by the inhabitants of that strange
world.</p>

<p>Much traveling was done by means of airplanes,
such as they had noticed when first they hovered
over the planet. These airplanes had no engines,
but were propelled by wireless from stations on land.
Freight planes, too, sailed prescribed courses, without
pilots, guided by a lone operator in a distant
tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>For a time things ran along smoothly but at last
Carl and Sana realized that they would soon have
to return to earth. Life was dear to them and their
days were numbered if they continued to live upon
Mars. The rarity of the atmosphere and the
strange mode of living was making its impression
upon them. Besides, they noted, the ever increasing
hostility on the part of some of the Martians.</p>

<p>Carl waited until their baby was born and Sana
well on the road to recovery, before making any
definite plans for the future.</p>

<p>Came the day, however, when they went once
more to the “Meteor” to leave that strange land.
And just in time. The plane literally swarmed with
Martians, who, from all appearances were doing
their utmost to dismantle it. At Carl’s approach
they fell back, taken by surprise.</p>

<p>One of the Martians, in particular, was quite
hostile and abusive. With a snarl he attempted to
take baby Charlie from Sana, who screamed to Carl
for help. Carl, with a spring, was at her side.
Without hesitating an instance he swung his arm and
landed a mighty blow on the head of the offender.
To the surprise of all, the Martian did not fall, but
went flying through the air, at a height of perhaps
twenty feet, to land in a misshapen heap some hundred
yards away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>This sight cowed the rest of them to a certain
extent. Carl had time to help Sana and the baby
into the cabin of the plane, give a hasty glance at
the mechanism at the head of the machine, climb
inside and shut the door, which automatically was
hermetically sealed.</p>

<p>Once more the Martians swarmed about the
“Meteor” in a last attempt to prevent its leaving
the ground. Their efforts were, of course, useless.
No power on earth or Mars could have held the
“Meteor,” once Carl established his electric zone,
the airplane would shoot forward at the speed of
electric waves. With a rush they were off, soaring
far out into space, followed, as they saw upon looking
back, by a myriad of Martian airplanes, which,
although capable of traveling at a speed greater than
any ordinary airplane of the earth, were soon out-distanced.</p>

<p>Looking at one of the wings, Carl saw, hanging
on, with a desperation caused by fear and astonishment,
a Martian at the end of the wing. Apparently
he had been unable to scramble off when the
“Meteor” had started.</p>

<p>Without saying anything to Sana as to this, Carl
flapped the encumbered wing in the way a bird
would, and saw the Martian torn from his grasp
and catapulted far out into space, only to describe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
a wide arc and fall like a plummet down into the
limitless depths. Would he, Carl mused, too become
a wanderer of the skies?</p>

<p>Putting the countless miles speedily behind them,
the “Meteor” at last came in sight of the moon.
Calling Sana to his side, Carl let their ship hover
above that cold dead world. The sight below them
was fearful—the planet was a veritable charnel-house.
Countless circular mountain ranges, looking
like great inactive volcanic craters, some of them
hundreds of miles in diameter and with ramparts
more than twenty-five thousand feet high, studded
the surface of the moon. Between these mountain
ranges the surface of the moon was scarred with
great clefts or crevices, evidently caused by the sudden
cooling of that planet.</p>

<p>Recalling that among the various books they had
with them, was one containing photographic maps
of the moon, compiled by the greatest of the earth’s
astronomers, Carl procured it and with Sana’s assistance,
compared the pictured maps with the planet
itself. Yes, there was the great Copernicus crater,
with its strange central peak rising some eleven
thousand feet from the bottom of the pit, although
the peak rose only some two thousand five hundred
feet above the surface of the moon. There was the
Plato crater, sixty miles in diameter with peaks over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
seven thousand feet high; Clavius, one hundred and
forty miles from rampart to rampart with peaks
sixteen thousand feet high; Herschel ninety miles in
diameter; Gauss and Humbolt each about one hundred
miles across. He recognized, too, the lunar
Apennines, some four thousand five hundred miles
long, soaring in rugged steps to a height of eighteen
thousand feet; the lunar Alps, consisting of some
hundred peaks, rising to a height of ten thousand
feet, while the great peaks of the Doerfel and
Leipnitz mountains overshadowed all in their majestic
heights of twenty-six to twenty-seven thousand
feet.</p>

<p>Gleaming white, dull red and brilliant yellow the
peaks and craters reflected the rays of the sun. A
beautiful sight, indeed, yet more impressive, to Carl,
was the fact that the planet they inspected was but
the skeleton of what might once have been a world
of life and progress. Who knows?</p>

<p>Leaving the moon behind, they headed for the
earth. The dust clouds had disappeared and the
land and water surfaces were clearly visible even at
their great distance. Their earth-home was once
again in sight. A feeling of happiness stole over
the returning wanderers. Truly, there is no place
like home.</p>

<p>Guiding the “Meteor” in the direction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
earth’s rotation, they swooped earthward, landing at
last in a highly vegetated field.</p>

<p>People were working the lands, using, Carl soon
saw, rather primitive implements. The alighting airplane
caused a great deal of commotion among these
people, but seeing that the people who stepped from
the machine were human beings, looking much like
themselves, they soon got over their fright, and came
forward, eager questions on their lips.</p>

<p>They spoke a sort of dialect English, and Carl
had little difficulty in making himself understood.
He informed them that he, too, was an earth-dweller,
who had returned with his wife and baby
from a trip to a distant world. Amazement was
plain on every face, but they assured him of their
belief in what he said, adding that they had never
before seen such a thing as the strange ship in which
he had come, although their books taught them that
there was a time when earth-men flew about in some
such machines.</p>

<p>Scarcely believing his ears, Carl asked them the
name of the country in which he had landed, and
was told it was called “Artonia.”</p>

<p>“Artonia? I have never heard of that. Where
is it in location to the rest of the world?”</p>

<p>He learned, then, that this was the region of the
one-time North Pole, as it was called ages ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“Ages ago? What year is it now?” he asked,
amazed.</p>

<p>“It is the year 3831,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“3831?” questioned his mind. Unbelievable!
Nearly two thousand years of earth-time had elapsed
during their journey, and to them it had seemed but
the matter of a year. Turning to Sana, Carl said,
“Is it possible that Einstein was right?”</p>

<p>If such changes had been wrought at the pole,
what had happened to the rest of the world? What
had become of the great cities of the world and their
people? Sadly they realized that they alone of the
old order of things existed. This world, their home,
would be as strange to them as Mars!</p>

<p>They might as well utilize their means of travel
and visit the other parts of the globe. The
“Meteor,” although badly strained by the severe use
to which it had been subjected in their flight, would
still suffice them on earth. They, in turn, had become
nomads of the earth—wanderers without a
place they could call home. Men without a world!</p>

<p>Their supply of the artificial food had about been
exhausted, and Carl questioned the strange folk as
to where he could purchase food. At his remark,
“But I have little money,” they asked curiously,
“Money? What is that?”</p>

<p>Carl tried to explain, but they did not understand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
He knew then that they, in their primitiveness had
not yet reached the stage where a standard form of
exchange was required. So he reverted to their
method of barter.</p>

<p>He had not much choice in the way of what to
offer. In fact the only things he had were his books.
Perhaps they would serve his purpose. And serve
his purpose they did. Cooked meats, fruits and
vegetables galore were given him in exchange for a
single book—a book of wild game hunt in Africa.
He noted with a smile, that it was the pictures that
interested these people. They passed the book from
hand to hand, looking at the highly colored illustrations,
like so many amused school children.</p>

<p>Promising these new made friends that they
would return to them, to tell them of what they had
seen in their tour of the world, they said goodbye,
and headed for Europe.</p>

<p>The Europe they had known was gone—gone
were the great centers of population, gone were the
peoples they had known, swallowed up, all, in the
relentless march of Time!</p>

<p>Gone too, were the great nations of Europe, as
Carl and Sana knew them. All that remained of
the once great British Empire was the little isle of
England—the rest of her domains had shaken off
the yoke and were independent countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>In France a greater change had taken place. The
one-time French race had completely extinguished
itself generations before. The land was now overrun
with a polyglot race of Russians and Germans,
who were more phlegmatic than ever.</p>

<p>Germany and the other countries of Europe, too,
were changed to such an extent that there was no
comparison between the order now in existence and
the order that had passed.</p>

<p>In all Europe laws of equality of man had been
established, so that now all men were equally rich,
or rather equally poor. Equally poor, because, there
was no longer any incentive or inducement to strive
to gain. The people had become drones to an extreme
degree. There was no reward for labor, so
none labored. No man tried to outdo his neighbor,
for in the end, his neighbor had as much as he.
Hence progress had ceased long ago. There was
no industry worthy of the name. Civilization, as
Carl and Sana knew it, was, too, a thing of the past.</p>

<p>To all appearances, the people existed only because
they did not die. Nothing mattered to them
but food, and as eating was a necessary evil, they
procured their food, individually, with as little exertion
as was possible. Too lazy, in most instances,
to even cook the fish and game they caught, they
ate it raw, and having filled their bellies, would lie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
down beside their mates to sleep until they were
hungry again.</p>

<p>Landing in North Africa, both Carl and Sana
were astounded at the changes that had taken place.
The once barren wastes of the desert country had
been converted, as if by the wave of a magic wand,
into a great agricultural country. The terrific heat
of the days and the freezing cold of the nights had
gone and in their place was a mild climate, similar
to that of the central United States. With this
great change had come prosperity; prosperity of
such magnitude as to even surpass that of Carl’s
own country at the time he and Sana had taken flight
from the earth.</p>

<p>The flooding of the lower desert areas, while
inundating tremendous territory, had caused the surrounding
lands to become fertile, rich in nitrates and
plant values. The people of the new, for such it
was, land, were the descendants of the one-time
semi-savage races. Now they numbered some two
hundred millions and in truth had become a mighty
race, rich in power and wealth.</p>

<p>On every hand, Carl and Sana saw bodies of
soldiers in training. On inquiring as to this, they
were informed that ages ago France had taught
them the military arts. Today these people believed
the entire world was in fear of them. In fact they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
were bragging of the great military strength and
boasted of the fact that for centuries no nation had
even so much as dared try to exploit them.</p>

<p>Sana pointed out to Carl that these people were
not as dark of skin as they were when the land
was still a desert. On hearing her remark, a native
man, of apparent great learning, and who was acting
as a sort of self-appointed guide to the couple, explained,
saying:</p>

<p>“Ages ago, that is, some two thousand years ago,
France used our people to fight her wars against
other nations of white peoples. France realized that
if she had more of us available to fight her battles,
she could soon gain control of the entire world. To
this end she established this great African country
of ours, believing at the time that the people of this
great land would always remain subject to her rule
and would always be at her call to aid her against
the world.</p>

<p>“In this she was partly right. If she could always
control the colonies of black peoples, she could defy
any nation on the earth.”</p>

<p>The speaker paused, then continued, with a smile
of satisfaction, “But France overlooked the fact that
France herself, as a white race was dying gradually.
She overlooked too, to what great extent the black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
races had mingled with the white French, with its
self-evident result.</p>

<p>“Today, the African and the Asiatic races rule
the world, thanks to the one-time French and the
English.</p>

<p>“We two colored races, that is the black and yellow
races, are the only ones on earth that amount to
anything. We are the mighty ones of the earth
today and none dare interfere or disturb us.</p>

<p>“When France realized that the tables were being
turned against her, and that she was sure to be the
loser, she tried to avert the impending disaster to
France, by attempting to make this great country a
barren waste of sand once more. But it was too
late. Too late for France to undo the great wrong
she had done the white races of the earth. We
were already strong enough to resist any such action
on her part. Rising up in our might, much to their
surprise, we overthrew our masters and became a
nation independent and free from the yoke that had
rested on our necks for so many years.</p>

<p>“From that time on the white French disappeared
still faster from the face of the earth. Our histories
tell us that in the course of the two following generations
there were no more white French in France.</p>

<p>“These colored people you now see here are to a
great extent the descendants of the French. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
other words they are the result of the mingling of
the white and the black, with the black, as you see,
predominating.”</p>

<p>“But how was it that the black races prospered
so?” Carl interrupted. Things were not quite clear
to him, as yet.</p>

<p>The answer came quickly—“You know from your
histories that the white races, from the beginning of
time, have been warring upon each other. You
know too, that the colored races have never fought
each other as have the whites. That is the answer.</p>

<p>“England aided the growth of the yellow race by
letting Japan overrun Russia. France conscripted
the black race to fight the white. What other outcome
was there to expect? Sooner or later the two
races must dominate. When the black and yellow
races are allowed to kill off the white, there could
be no other result.</p>

<p>“And, because that result was inevitable, so it has
come to pass. Today where are the whites? Scattered
over the earth! But they are nobody. Their
ambition lies dormant; they are even too lazy to
procure their food. They are a dying race.</p>

<p>“But we colored people are different. We are
the civilized peoples of the earth. Our civilization
has taken the place of that of the white peoples
some two thousand years ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>The truth became clear to Carl and Sana as they
listened to the speaker’s words. The hypocrisy of
nations, like that of individuals, ends with disaster.</p>

<p>Asking whether all these great changes had been
wrought in a natural way, Carl was told “Not quite
so. At the time when the Sahara, as it was then
known, was changed from a desert into a flowering
garden, there was, according to history, a great
astronomical upheaval, destroying great cities, and
killing millions of people. Ever since, the ‘great
comet,’ which will soon be visible in the sky, has
appeared daily. Then our colored people with the
mixture of the French blood get excited. They cannot
lose their fear.”</p>

<p>Sana smiled, saying, “After two thousand years
they are still excited and afraid.”</p>

<p>In the days that followed Carl and Sana, in their
wanderings about this strange country, were soon
convinced of the truth of the things they had been
told. Much as they would have liked to remain here
and study the civilization and people about them,
they desired to hasten to America. Of Sana’s homestead
on the Gurara Oasis there was nothing to be
seen. Ages ago all that was dear to Sana had been
buried deep beneath the waves of the great inland
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>So getting once more into the “Meteor” they set
out for Carl’s beloved country.</p>

<p>America, too, had changed, Carl found to his
great regret, when the “Meteor” alighted at the site
of what was once the world’s greatest city. Gone
were the towering buildings of New York, gone
were its millions of people. In its place was naught
but a great sandy plain, or better, a plateau, extending
for miles in all directions, and unpeopled save
for a few straggling groups of rude hut-like shelters.</p>

<p>In landing the “Meteor” had come to a stop at
a point that Carl figured was approximately lower
Broadway. Nearby some excavating work was being
done by a group of white-bearded men, who at
the sight of the airplane dropped their implements
and came hurrying towards it. Upon questioning
these men Carl learned that they were scientists who
had come from the cities that lay in the distant West,
to learn something about the civilization that had
existed on the Atlantic coast in the days of the past.</p>

<p>To the best of their knowledge, they explained,
some thousand or so years ago the entire coast had
been devastated by great tidal waves, followed by
terrible earthquakes causing untold destruction. Volcanic
eruptions, too, had added to the havoc, burying
the lands, for thousands of square miles, under millions
of tons of lava and rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>Leading him to the pit where Carl had first seen
them, the excavators asked him to peer down the
deep shaft they had dug. At the bottom, some two
hundred feet below him, Carl saw the tower of the
great Woolworth Building of old New York.</p>

<p>Asking them what they sought, the answer came,
“Knowledge. We of today have little need for the
material things of Life. Ours is a search for the
Truth, and we must hurry.”</p>

<p>The spokesman of the party pointed heavenward.
Carl, following the directing finger with his eyes,
saw in blazing brilliance, the great comet whose first
appearance had caused Sana and he to flee the earth.
While in Europe he had noticed it, but had paid
little attention to it, being too absorbed in the things
around him. The peoples of Europe, too, had taken
it as an accepted thing of life.</p>

<p>The stranger continued, “That has been there in
the heavens as long as man can remember, but we
who know, realize that it is coming closer and closer
to the earth. Just when that final rush will come,
the rush that shall bring destruction to this world,
we do not know, but we fear that the day is not far
off. For myself I care not. The day can come
anytime and I will be ready. For the sake of the
truths we are seeking, however, I hope that that day
will never come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>A strange world indeed, mused Carl, when the
knowledge of truth dominates and man’s personal
ambitions are secondary!</p>

<p>Wandering around Carl and Sana saw how complete
the destruction had been. The wonderful
Palisades of the Hudson had disappeared, the river
itself having been turned from its bed many miles
away. The East River, too, was gone, having been
filled with lava and rock as had a great part of Long
Island Sound.</p>

<p>While on one of their wonder-filled trips of exploration,
they came upon an extinct volcanic crater,
very similar in size and appearance to some they
had seen on the moon. The air, that day, seemed
more oppressive than usual and the heat terrific.</p>

<p>Seeking coolness in the shadow of a great boulder
on the rampart of this crater, Sana sat down, her
baby in her arms, while Carl stood nearby studying
the wonderful formations of rock and lava at every
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the air was filled with a great roaring
sound, a sound so terrific that it was deafening. A
light, brighter than that of a hundred suns, illumined
the earth. With a rush the realization was upon
them. The comet was fast approaching the earth—the
end of the world was at hand.</p>

<p>Then the collision—the earth shook under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
impact—the air was filled with dust and smoke.
Fearful for the safety of his beloved ones, Carl
sprang to them, to clutch them tightly in his arms.
Then darkness!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Someone laughing? Carl opened his eyes. Of
course they were laughing at him, lying at the feet
of his camel, from whose back he had fallen in his
sleep, with his arms tightly hugging the camel’s legs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

UNDER THE KNIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARL, endeavoring to get to his feet, was
aware of a severe pain in his side. His left
foot, too, pained him and was unable to support
any weight. Struggling at last to an upright
position, he staggered forward a few steps, only to
lurch head first into the burning desert sand. Immediately
the other tourists were off their camels and
at his side. A hasty examination proved that his
left ankle was badly broken and that, from all appearances,
he had suffered internal injuries in his fall
from the camel.</p>

<p>Everything possible was done to relieve his pain
and make him as comfortable as possible. With
great care he was literally hoisted aboard one of
the camels, and strapped on its back, where he was
held secure from a further fall by one of the guides
who rode behind him.</p>

<p>The place of Carl’s accident was near the Wadi
Draa River, flowing past the southern end of the
Atlas Mountains, so they were still some two hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
and fifty miles, about four days’ ride from
Mogador, the terminus of the caravan.</p>

<p>Accordingly the caravan headed for the nearest
town, Glisscim, but here they found only a native
doctor, to whose care none was willing to entrust
the sick man. Securing an automobile, the only one
to be had and a ramshackle bouncing affair at that,
Carl was driven to Mogador. Here, too, disappointment
was in store for him. Suffering although
he was from the pain in his side and ankle, Carl
would not consent to gamble his chances on the more
or less speculative knowledge of the only doctor in
that locality.</p>

<p>Another hundred miles of pain-tortured automobile
ride and he reached Marrakesh, the beautiful
southern capital of Morocco, lying at the foot of
the Atlas Mountains, whose snow covered peaks provided
a wondrous contrast to the great groves of
palms that formed a background for the city. It
was at Marrakesh that the celebrated feudal chieftain
of the southern country, El Hadj Thami
Glaouri, made his home, being attracted to the city
by its great groves of cypress and olive trees and its
wonderful gardens of tropical beauty.</p>

<p>At the hospital, Carl, much to his delighted surprise,
was placed under the care of the prominent
French physician Dr. Thuillier. After a thorough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
examination, which confirmed the belief of the tourists,
Carl was placed in bed. The hospital was
rather crowded with soldiers wounded in the war,
but room was found for him in one of the wards.</p>

<p>That was on a Thursday night. The following
morning X-ray pictures were taken to ascertain the
true nature of the fracture in his leg, and Friday
not being an operating day, but a “meatless one,” as
was laughingly explained to him, Carl had to wait
for “butcher day,” which was Saturday, for the
operation.</p>

<p>Among the nurses at the hospital there were a
few white women, one of whom, Carl soon learned,
was an American, Grace Huntington. She came
from New York, where she had been employed as
a stenographer and secretary prior to the outbreak
of the war. When the war came she went to France
as a nurse, like so many of her American sisters.
During her service with the armies she had met Dr.
Thuillier, who had accompanied a regiment of semi-savage
Moroccan soldiers to France. He, seeing
that she made a wonderful nurse, made her an attractive
offer, which, in her enthusiasm, she readily
accepted, going to Marrakesh at the termination of
her work in France.</p>

<p>Grace was young and very attractive, as Carl soon
noticed. Carl was attractive, too, it seemed, as from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
the outset complaints were made that she paid more
attention to him than was necessary.</p>

<p>Carl was much interested in the sights about him,
and particularly in the behavior of several men, who,
still under the influence of the ether, were brought
back to the ward from the operating room. One of
these was a young Englishman who, coming out of
the ether became very restless and talkative. So
restless was he that two nurses had to hold him
down, but all the while he kept talking of and to
his sweetheart. This made Carl wonder whether
he, when coming back from the plane of unconsciousness,
would talk of Sana, his beloved, for whom his
heart was crying bitterly. He hoped not, after hearing
the jeers that greeted the words of the soldier.
Furthermore, he could not reconcile himself to the
thought of having Grace hear anything of Sana.
But he reasoned to himself, that if what he had
heard from others was true, he would talk. Much
of this talking on the part of a patient he had been
told was induced by suggestion on the part of the
nurses at hand.</p>

<p>Friday night, much to his embarrassment, he was
shaved and prepared for the operation the following
morning. Grace, he noticed, was also visibly embarrassed,
although he thought this strange, as it
must have been a usual occurrence in the line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
duty. He could not account for it, but he was too
tired and hungry to bother much about her feelings
toward him. Hungry he was, and much to his
chagrin had to be satisfied with half a roll and a
glass of water.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Grace again came to his
side to make him ready for the ordeal. Another
coat of iodine, “war paint” she called it, was applied
to his side, a white woolen shirt and a pair of
long woolen stockings put on him and he was placed
upon a wheel stretcher. Blankets were put over
him with his arms beneath them, and his body tightened
down with two strong belts. A victim, trussed
for the slaughter, Carl mused bitterly.</p>

<p>In the operating room Carl was turned over to
three women nurses; the history of his case being
given them. Without further ado he was transferred
to the operating table.</p>

<p>A young French doctor was attending to the ether
apparatus while a nurse came up to Carl with a
book in her hand and requested his signature. Asking
what this meant, he was told that it was but a
matter of routine. Anticipating that he was expected
to sign his life away before the operation, in case
he died from it, the nurse confirmed his belief. Reluctantly
Carl signed the book, knowing that he had
no alternative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>The doctor was having some trouble with the
ether bottles and the attachment of the gas mask.
While fixing things, he laughingly told a story of
two boys, who were bragging about their fathers—the
one had said that his father had electricity in
his hair to which the other retorted that his father
had gas on his stomach.</p>

<p>Disgusted beyond words at this lack of consideration
on the doctor’s part for his patient, Carl heard
him say, “Come, you had better take some gas now.”</p>

<p>The mask was adjusted over his face and the
ether turned on. A sweet sickening odor entered
Carl’s nostrils followed by a light-headed feeling.
The stuff was doing its work fast. Making up his
mind that he would not say a word of Sana, when
coming out of the ether, he began to count. The
possibility of his never coming out of it did not
occur to him. He had reached the count of nine
when sparks of all colors and shades, radiated from
his brain, with a tremendous noise, to all corners of
the room and beyond. They were like sparks from
a huge induction coil of a wireless station. The
count was thirteen when Carl suddenly exclaimed,
“Oh no—I am not in an electric chair!”</p>

<p>Through his mind ran the argument he had so
often propounded to the men of his profession. He
was firmly convinced a person electrocuted in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
electric chair, was not dead and that he could be
revived with a high frequency apparatus. Many an
electrical equipment operator has been successfully
revived after receiving equally as heavy or even
more powerful electrical shocks from high tension
apparatus in electrical central stations. These operators
lay on the ground as though really dead;
their hearts do not beat and any doctor would pronounce
them dead; yet many of them are brought
to life again.</p>

<p>After official electrocutions an autopsy is performed
upon the body, and the heart removed.
This, of course, kills the person, but the electrical
shocks do not necessarily kill.</p>

<p>No state, he had contended, making use of the
barbaric electrocution, would dare to apply high
frequency apparatus to a criminal after he had been
removed from the electric chair. It would expose
the fact that many an individual had not been
legally and according to law, executed in the electric
chair.</p>

<p>When Carl stopped counting the doctor asked him
“Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>Carl wanted to reply in the affirmative, but his
voice failed him. So he nodded his head in answer
to the query.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>The young physician promptly exclaimed, “Hell
you do!”</p>

<p>Carl meekly thought, “I ought to know better.”</p>

<p>He now heard Dr. Thuillier, the chief surgeon,
say, “Well, where is that young American?”</p>

<p>Then someone placed a hand on his left arm and
he became unconscious instantly. From that time
on, until three hours later, he knew nothing of what
was happening to him.</p>

<p>Besides the doctors and nurses participating in the
operation, there were several other doctors or internes
present to study the case. To these, Dr.
Thuillier explained the nature of the accidental injury
and the method of operating. The work was
quite complicated because of the delay that had ensued
since the time of the accident. At the end of
an hour, however, Carl was wheeled back to the
ward and put to bed, with Nurse Grace to watch
over him until he came out of the ether.</p>

<p>While still under the ether, Carl dreamed that
he had at last perfected an invention on which he
had been working for years. This invention was
the one thing that could be acclaimed as one hundred
per cent. perfect. His long cherished dreams
had come true! He had devised an apparatus by
means of which he could throw upon a screen scenes
from any part of the globe, that is, the actual scenes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
of happenings as they were taking place at some
distant point the very moment we projected them
upon the screen in front of his machine. Incidents
taking place thousands of miles away were pictured
before one’s eyes as if they were at the scene itself.
If he wanted a street scene say of San Francisco,
Tokio, Paris or London, all he would have to do
would be to place the indicator upon the dial map,
pointing to the city in question, and it was done—the
scene was before his eyes.</p>

<p>Carl had been industriously working on this telephoto
device during the war. His idea was to observe
the movement of the armies, believing that
with it he could end the war and prevent all future
wars. No military movement would be secret, no
advance unobserved, with his machine.</p>

<p>The idea was first born in his mind after a talk
with a great detective who was looking for evidence
against some suspected criminals. Carl had come
to the detective’s aid with a device whereby he could
see what was going on in a closed room. He placed
wires along the picture molding of the room, during
the suspected one’s absence, and the four ends of the
wire he provided with “eyes,” his secret invention.
These wires led from the room to a place at some
distance away, where the apparatus reflected the entire
room upon a large mirror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>This device he had improved upon until at last,
instead of wires and the “eyes” he had been able
to accomplish the same result by means of wireless.</p>

<p>The war over, he continued his experiments on
the device, intending to use it in connection with his
lectures on city planning.</p>

<p>In his delirium, he was addressing a large audience
and demonstrating his device. He pointed the
indicator to Paris, saying, “Here we have a city,
where Baron Hausmann, under the great Napoleon,
remodeled the entire city, broke through new thoroughfares,
made plazas and squares, at an expense
of some two hundred and thirty million dollars.
The scene before you is that of the Place du Chatelet,
with the monument at the end of the bridge,
or rather beyond the bridge, acting as a focal point.
Note the good treatment of the traffic waterway, the
well planned boulevards, the uniform height of the
buildings as well as the ornamental shade trees on
both sides of all streets. Surely, here are examples
for our American cities.”</p>

<p>Turning the indicator upon Duesseldorf, one of
the foremost cities, where the art of city planning
has been practised for generations, Carl said, “Here
is the river promenade on the Rhine in Duesseldorf.
Where can we find in our own country a similar
scene of such civic improvement? At the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
level you see the electric unloading machinery and
the busy vehicles hauling away the freight of the
river boats. On the upper level in the wide promenade,
flanked on one side with shade trees and on the
other with the great balustrade, giving an open view
of the river and the monumental bridge in the distance.
Observe, also, the highly ornamental electroliers.
Duesseldorf is no larger than Jersey City,
but who ever goes to Jersey City for the sake of
seeing anything beautiful. Where could we, in our
own country, find such a scene, as this, of business
and pleasure combined. Yet all this could be duplicated
in America if the principle were but understood.
As will be seen, city planning develops artistic
taste, civic pride and patriotism. It also makes
for better citizenship, adds to our comfort and our
happiness and it stimulates industrial prosperity.</p>

<p>“Of late we have heard so much of Tut-Ankh-Amen,
one of the great Pharaohs. Let us see if we
can locate him.” Shifting the indicator back and
forth over the map of Egypt, Carl continued, “Here
we have the sand waves sweeping in their slow but
inevitable march past the silent Sphinx and the pyramids
at Luxor. Yes, here it is. We see before us
the last resting-place of a great Pharaoh, which
for some 3400 years has remained undisturbed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
But now it has been entered and its valuable treasures
taken away by a group of archeologists.</p>

<p>“Witness the procession of visitors in carriages
and on camel’s back, all come to gape with awe at
the funeral fittings of a king. We cannot look down
into the tomb itself, but we can see the valuable
treasures as they are carefully carried away on
stretchers borne by native Egyptians who apparently
have no scruples against despoiling the grave of a
ruler of their country.</p>

<p>“We see here treasure chests, costly vases, chairs,
thrones and the like, as well as the mummy of the
king. Art as well as history may gain to a great extent,
but let us consider a while. Is it right?</p>

<p>“Tut-Ankh-Amen, as well as the other Pharaohs,
was buried according to the rites of the religion of
Egypt. In his mortal life he had this great tomb
prepared, so that his body could be placed in it, when
death came, and remain untouched through the ages.
After the king had been buried and the last seal put
in place, the tomb became consecrated ground, hallowed
to the memory of the life that had departed.
Because of this, many a logical mind will consider
the ruthless digging up of the remains a ghoulish
act and a desecration of the body’s last resting-place.
Surely if it were the grave of a less notable person
than an ancient Pharaoh such would be the description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
of the act and the diggers would be called
‘ghouls’ and ‘grave robbers’ instead of archeologists.</p>

<p>“What would be said if some wealthy or more
powerful foreign nation came to our own country
to carry away the bodies of our great Washington
or Lincoln, or say of some of our soldiers who lost
their lives on the field of battle?</p>

<p>“It may be said that the removal of these highly
valuable treasures will serve mankind, but mankind
could be better served if the cost of such removal
were used in the aiding of needy peoples.</p>

<p>“Beneath Constantinople, the Turkish capital, are
buried the treasures of the old Pashas, and this is
one of the reasons that makes both England and
Russia so anxious to control that city.</p>

<p>“The treasures buried with Kings, Pashas or
Pharaohs were buried in accordance with the beliefs
of the people, and no other nation, especially
a nation of a different religion, should have the right
to exploit these graves and treasures to their own
advantage.</p>

<p>“However, that is but a matter of opinion and has
nothing to do with my new invention, the telephoto
device, which has enabled you to see these things
for yourselves.”</p>

<p>Tremendous applause greeted Carl as he finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
his lecture. Immensely elated, he shouted, “I am
satisfied. I have a machine that is one hundred per
cent. perfect.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth, when a
great seven-league boot kicked him off the globe,
while a voice said, “The hell you have!”</p>

<p>Falling through space he looked back and saw
another man, a young fellow he had seen in his audience,
pick up the machine saying, “Here we have it,
one hundred per cent. perfect.”</p>

<p>And again came the gigantic boot and the voice,
“The hell you have!” and he, too, slid off the
planet.</p>

<p>A second man, one of the type termed “nut” came
along and seeing the device, called out gleefully,
“Years ago I invented this, but could not make it
work. Now I shall claim it mine.”</p>

<p>And again that sneering “The hell you will!” followed
by so forceful a kick that the old man flew in
a wide arc over Carl’s head and descended rapidly
to the depths beneath.</p>

<p>All the while Carl noticed that it was becoming
hotter and hotter. At first he could not grasp the
meaning of it, but then came the dawning of the
truth that Hades was his destination. He turned
around and screamed, “What is all this about?”</p>

<p>From somewhere in the far distance, he heard a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
deep even voice respond, “Young man, if everybody
should come into the possession of one hundred per
cent. perfection, which by the way is an impossibility,
there would be no incentive for improvement, and
that would stagnate all possible progress.”</p>

<p>Carl became intensely hot and was perspiring
dreadfully. His very vitals were burning and a terrible
thirst was consuming him, but he managed to
say, “But I have it and I am going to hold on to it!”</p>

<p>A hand was on his arm, and a melancholy yet
sweet voice barely audible came to him, saying,
“Please, Mr. Lohman, have a drink.”</p>

<p>Carl was but half awake, his mind still floating in
airy regions, but he managed to rouse himself, and
opening his eyes, he saw his charming nurse, Grace,
standing at the side of his bed.</p>

<p>A teaspoonful of warm water was poured between
his parched lips. That was all he could have just
then, but to the fevered man it was nectar of the
gods.</p>

<p>Carl, on regaining full consciousness was anxious
to know whether he had said anything of Sana during
his coma. He questioned nurse Grace guardedly,
but was told that he had only grunted like a
little pig for a time and then had mechanically delivered
a lecture on the tombs of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>Satisfied, Carl dosed off into a fitful sleep, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
awakened some hours later, by plaintive strains of
music. Twisting his head in the direction from
which the sounds came, Carl beheld three musicians
standing at the entrance of the ward. He recalled
then, of having heard that they came every Saturday
evening to play to the suffering patients.</p>

<p>Upon the strangely stirred spirit of Carl, the
magic of this weird native music had a subtle effect,
and burying his face in the pillow, he wept bitterly,
weeping only as a strong man can weep.</p>

<p>That night no sleep would come to his tired eyes.
The pain in his side had increased much to his alarm.
Speaking of it to the night nurse, she gave him an
injection, but it had little effect. Through the long
hours of the silent night he lay staring with unseeing
eyes at the ceiling above him.</p>

<p>The whole of the next day Carl received no nourishment
save a glass of lemon water, although food
was promised him the following day. That night
another injection of morphine was given him, and
peaceful sleep came to the tired man.</p>

<p>One hospital day was like another. But on the
sixth day Carl became very ill. His pulse raced and
his temperature rose rapidly. A high fever set in,
torturing his very soul.</p>

<p>Carl noted that the night nurse had spoken to
Grace of his condition when she arrived in the morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Her serious face, when asking him how he felt,
worried Carl greatly. He began to ponder on the
success of the operation. Was it likely to end
fatally? But then he did not care. Sana was gone,
burned alive, and in a large measure due to his own
fault. Ever since that fateful hour he had been
thinking of how he could have saved his beloved if
he had only acted the part of the hero; the hero of
story book and screen. He had saved Sana from
the clutches of Amshied and he blamed himself for
not having taken sufficient precautions when leaving
the burning building. As yet he did not know how
he had been put out of action—all he remembered
was the blow that sent him reeling down in a heap.</p>

<p>Such thoughts depressed him, and he cared little
whether he lived or not.</p>

<p>Although puzzled at this turn of affairs, Grace
assured him that he was in no great danger. Two
assistant doctors, in the absence of the head doctor,
were called, but they could not say just what was
the matter. When Dr. Thuillier came, however, a
hasty examination was all that was necessary to disclose
the nature of the trouble. An abscess had
formed in the wound, and it was necessary to re-open
it. This was immediately done, the abscess
removed, and the incision closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>After this second operation Carl’s fever left him
and he was much easier.</p>

<p>For three long weeks after that Carl remained
at the hospital, gaining in strength slowly but surely.
During this time Grace was constantly at his side,
tenderly nursing him with all possible skill and
patience.</p>

<p>At last came the day when he was pronounced
fit to leave. During the weeks of his convalescence,
Grace had often told him of her desire to return to
New York—she was tired of the desert, of the hospital,
of everything in this foreign land. She wanted
to go home. So it had been mutually agreed that
they would go home together.</p>

<p>So together, Carl and Grace, bade goodbye to
their friends at Marrakesh and left for Mogador,
where they hoped to find passage by steamer to
New York.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

THE RUM-RUNNERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARL and Grace had luck in catching the
boat. Sailings from Mogador are few
and far between, but the English freight
steamer “Resolute” was at the wharf, loading for a
return trip to New York. Inquiring of the vessel’s
master as to the chances of securing passage, Carl
was directed to the purser’s office, where he made
arrangements for himself and Grace. Besides themselves,
three other passengers had been booked for
the trip.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the steamer weighed anchor,
and Grace and Carl, standing at the rail, waved
farewell to the shores of Africa.</p>

<p>Carl soon made friends with the other men passengers,
and much to his amazement, soon discovered
that the “Resolute” was a rum-boat, operated
by a New York bootlegging gang. Captain Billings
and the first and second officers, he learned, were in
the pay of this gang and were known to be ruthless
in their methods of dealing with any member of the
crew who saw fit to disagree with them. Billings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
was an American, who prior to taking up this
calling, had been master of a Gloucester fishing
schooner. Although legally without right to take
charge of a steamer of the size of the “Resolute,”
he had been given papers by the English concern,
which, to all appearances, operated the steamer as
a freight boat, but which, in truth, was but a subsidiary
of the rum-running organization.</p>

<p>He learned, too, that the vessel had stowed away
in its holds, some ninety thousand gallons of whisky
and brandy, with a value of perhaps seven hundred
and fifty thousand dollars. This liquor had been
taken aboard at Cadiz, in Spain, to which port it
had been originally shipped from England and
France. From Cadiz the ship had gone to Mogador,
which was listed as one of its ports of call, to
take on a miscellaneous cargo. This, Carl was assured,
was but another step in the concealing of the
true nature of the steamer’s operations.</p>

<p>Carl was told that if trouble arose he must not be
surprised. Out of Cadiz, the crew had mutinied,
but were subdued by Billings and his gunmen, who
even now were somewhere on board the boat, ready
at an instant’s notice to quell whatever disturbance
might arise. At Mogador, the crew had deserted
the vessel, and a new one engaged from the riffraff
of the wharves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>Naturally, Carl had many doubts as to the truth
of his informant’s statements, but these doubts were
driven from his mind the following morning. He
had been awakened by loud voices and general uproar.
Upon investigating, he found that the crew
had discovered the true nature of the cargo, and had
demanded more pay. Their demands being refused,
they had tried to persuade Billings to put back for
Mogador. In this, too, they failed.</p>

<p>Then they had tried more direct action to obtain
their “just rights” as they called them. But, to their
chagrin, the four gunmen, of whom Carl had heard,
were upon them, with threats of gun play if they
did not go aft. The men could not resist now and
were willing to cry “quits!”</p>

<p>Billings, however, wished to set his new crew an
example, so three of the men, at his command, were
clamped into irons and made prisoners below deck.</p>

<p>Then to show the men that he could play square
with them, although everyone doubted it, he promised
the crew a bonus at the end of the voyage and
plenty of whisky during it.</p>

<p>From that time on, Carl and the rest of the passengers
were wise in staying within the confines of
the passenger deck. The crew was literally drunk
at all times. How they managed to do their work
was a mystery to Carl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>The slow tedious passage to New York was quite
uneventful after the uprising had been taken care of,
with the exception of the storm they encountered
the fifth day out. Early that morning a gale sprang
up, increasing in velocity until, by noon, it was a
roaring hurricane. The “Resolute” was slowed
down to almost a standstill, her engines running just
enough to keep her head on to the wind. During the
storm, which lasted over fifteen hours, the decks
were continually swept with great waves, which tore
away rafts and boat, broke ports twenty feet above
the water line and flooded the staterooms. One of
the passengers ventured out on deck during the
storm and was picked up with a broken leg, having
been thrown heavily against the cabin walls by a
great mass of water.</p>

<p>The crew sobered up considerably during the
storm, while the three men in irons were willing to
promise anything if they were released.</p>

<p>Some seventeen days later, Carl was told that they
were nearing New York. Long before reaching
port, however, wireless messages were sent out to
the effect that the ship had developed some slight
boiler troubles, at the same time giving her location,
but adding that no assistance was needed. Knowing
that there was nothing wrong below decks, Carl figured
that this was but a code message intended for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
the bootleggers, who were awaiting the arrival of
the vessel.</p>

<p>When the ship was about ten miles from New
York, Captain Billings gave the command to cast
anchor. At nine o’clock sharp that evening, a red
rocket was sent up. Within half an hour, an auxiliary
schooner, the “Viking,” commanded by a
former Customs guard, was lying alongside the
“Resolute.” Under the direction of the Captain
and the watchful eyes of the gunmen the crew was
immediately set to discharging the treasure of liquor.</p>

<p>This work kept the men busy the entire night.
Early the next morning two fast motorboats came
up and drew alongside the steamer. The men
boarded the “Resolute” and with the aid of the latter’s
crew a large number of cases of whisky were
put on board the motorboats, which then sped away.</p>

<p>Hardly had they departed with their treasure,
however, when one of the motorboats was stopped
by a large powerboat. This took place near enough
to the “Resolute” to enable Carl to read its name—“Buzzard.”
The crew of this latter boat was heavily
armed, and resistance being useless, the cases
were transferred from the smaller boat to the
“Buzzard,” which Carl now recognized as one of
the much spoken of pirate outfits gotten up to terrorize
other rum-running vessels. The commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
of this vessel no doubt had an understanding with
Captain Billings so that the latter’s employers, the
New York bootlegging gang, would be cheated out
of the liquor as well as the price the rum-runners
had paid for it.</p>

<p>The other motorboat, as well as the schooner
“Viking” got away, but the “Resolute” was picked
up by a Government dry navy patrol boat. This
patrol had been on the lookout for a fleet of five
English rum-laden vessels, some twenty miles out at
sea off Fire Island. These English ships were supposed
to be the mother ships of the rum-runners.
The patrols had been given orders to board and
capture the English vessels at high sea in order to
test out a custom house ruling to the effect that the
Federal authorities had the right to seize and search
beyond the three mile limit.</p>

<p>A comparatively small quantity of liquor was
found on board, but a list was found of the foremost
New York hotel managers, evidently bootleg customers.
The vessel and cargo, as well as some three
hundred thousand dollars in gold, found in an iron
chest was seized by the authorities and taken to New
York, where the officers and crew were confined to
jail. At the court hearing the next morning, the
Captain explained, “I delivered the liquor on the
high seas and not within the jurisdiction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
United States Government. The liquor still on the
ship is bound for Bermuda and not for your country.
I was at the wheel and when the prohibition
boat came along I took it for a pirate ship. Even
when I heard the voice through the megaphone,
‘Heave to, we are Revenue men,’ I thought they
were pirates and at first I intended ramming their
ship. On second thought I demanded that they turn
their searchlight on their flag and crew. When this
was done I could see that they were indeed Revenue
men and I was glad to have them come aboard a
British boat outside the three mile limit.”</p>

<p>The judge questioned Billings as to how he had
come into possession of so large an amount of gold
and was informed that it was customary for rum-running
captains to demand gold, because of the
large amount of counterfeit money the bootleggers
had succeeded in passing in payment of the liquors.</p>

<p>However, the prisoners were soon released.
After a visit from the British Ambassador, the
wheels of official Washington began turning and it
was ruled that the three mile limit must be observed
in the search of foreign vessels. The pressure
brought to bear probably did not have “the freedom
of the seas” so much in mind as the fact that three
miles from shore meant easier work for the rum-runners
in their efforts to land the contraband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>In the meantime Carl had landed and re-established
himself in New York.</p>

<p>The accounts in the newspapers as to the seizing
of the “Resolute” were amusing to him owing to the
way facts appeared to have been juggled. He related
his story at the club that night to several of
his friends. One of them, a Doctor Rowland, was
rather surprised and proceeded to tell his side of
the story.</p>

<p>“My chauffeur, John, was arrested last night by
a dry agent, while he had twenty cases of brandy in
his car, which came from the ‘Resolute.’ He had
gotten the liquor at an East River dock, from a motorboat,
the crew of which was dispensing the
liquor to a number of customers who had paid for
protection. However, John’s load was seized just
as he was about to enter my garage. The cases were
unloaded into a truck standing nearby and John was
placed under arrest and ordered to accompany the
agent to the police station. After they had ridden
a block or so, they let him go. The joke of the
whole affair was that John was arrested by a man
undoubtedly posing as a dry agent. He might have
been one—but how do we know? I inquired and
learned that the seizure of the liquor had not been
reported to the authorities. So I am the loser, to
the extent of two thousand dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>The two men enjoyed a hearty laugh as Doctor
Rowland continued, “Last month, our friend
White’s chauffeur was held up by two gunmen just
as he was leaving the dock with a load of liquor in
the evening. You know certain policemen are tipped
off to stay away from that particular section for an
hour or two on certain nights. The gunmen jumped
into his car and pointing their revolvers at him,
forced him to drive past an empty lot. When there
he was kicked out and the thieves drove off with the
car, liquor and all. White found the car standing
in front of his home the next morning.</p>

<p>“There is no questioning the fact that certain
men accept bribes to have the booze removed from
the boats, then put the holdup gang on to the trick,
for a consideration, and still further benefit probably
by dividing the booty itself. Just plain double-crossing.</p>

<p>“Last week the Federal grand jury censured several
dry agents for taking large quantities of liquor
out of government warehouses where it had been
stored after seizure. These agents, however,
claimed that they did not sell the stuff, but gave it
away to their friends and relatives. Who wants to
believe them?</p>

<p>“There are all kinds and forms of rum-selling going
on and the men engaged in it make big and easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
money. I understand that a certain party here in
New York bought several yachts and is sailing them
between New York and nearby English possessions,
engaged in the bootlegging business. His yachts
keep outside of the three mile limit where the rum-runners
meet them with hard cash. He is making
a lot of money and is running no risk. Once the
stuff is on land there is no lack of buyers. And some
way is always found to supply their wants. In fact
a friend of mine told me that in one of our boroughs
whisky is distributed from oil delivery wagons in
the conventional oil cans. These wagons have regular
routes, calling on their established customers
once a week.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Carl, “you are a good writer;
why don’t you write a story about these pirates, the
double dealing crooks and dishonest dry agents. It
would make corking good reading and the people
would see that our country, after all, is not as dry
as the Sahara.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. I don’t want to be a ‘marked
man.’ You know they would get me in the long run,
even if they had to ‘frame me’ and ‘frame me’ they
would. You, as every one else who wishes to, know
too well the custom in this respect. And if they did
‘frame me,’ they would have so very little respect
for decency and honor that they would call me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
liar, even if I had made a sworn statement in advance
that such would be the case.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thinking it over,” said Carl, “it seems best
that we raise no objection to their crooked business
and simply pretend that we know nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“But it is a fine state of affairs when a law, such
as the dry law, causes untold evils. It not only
makes law and home breakers, but it makes liars
and hypocrites. It causes children to disrespect
their parents; it causes divorces and as the records
show, it fills the jails more than ever. Doctors are
against it, as it undermines health and in many a
case death has been the result of the lack of alcoholic
stimulant. Besides it costs the people more in the
way of taxation to make up the losses in revenue
which were formerly derived from breweries, saloons
and distilleries. Now the balance has to be
struck by taxing the dear public.</p>

<p>“While home-brew is much in vogue, most of the
stuff would kill an elephant. We are surely getting
ourselves into a nice mess, even to the extent of getting
into difficulties with foreign diplomats and their
countries. And what is probably worst of all is
the frightful use of deadly drugs and its disastrous
consequences.</p>

<p>“There is no getting away from it. It undermines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
the morals and health, and how many murders
have already been committed on account of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great life if you don’t weaken.” Carl
laughed. “Yes, it’s a great life if you don’t
weaken! But what becomes of the country? This
may go on for some years, with conditions getting
worse daily, while our dry advocates and agents will
continue to tell us through the papers, and otherwise,
that every day in every way the country is getting
drier and drier.</p>

<p>“That they are deliberately distorting the truth
of the situation and quoting figures and so-called
facts, which they themselves do not believe, will not
deter them in their efforts to make the people like it.
That is their big job—make the people like the
medicine the quacks prescribed for them.</p>

<p>“One of the surest indications of public opinion is
the way politicians and candidates use the conditions
as they now exist in their efforts to get into office.
Prior to the going to the polls, these candidates appeal
to the people’s reason, or state of mind, as they
call it—appeal to them to abolish the dry law; to
regain the liberties they have lost. Oh, yes, these
candidates, if elected, will restore those lost liberties!
Oh, yes, they will—not. But the people fall
for it—and that helps, from a political point of
view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“As you have, of course, found out through your
own observations, these pre-election promises are
never kept. After election, promises are memories
only—and then often only in the minds of the people
who elected that particular candidate to office.
He immediately even discards the memory of his
promises.</p>

<p>“From the voter’s point of view the outcome is to
be regretted, as is true of many other issues that
arise from time to time. But it shows the sentiment
of the people. If they were for prohibition and the
consequent results of such enforcement as we have
had foisted upon us, office seekers would never
dream of appealing to them as they do.</p>

<p>“But to get back to those who do preach prohibition,
even if they do not practise it. Do you know,
that many of these ‘private’ dry agents get big pay
from wealthy individuals, who accumulated their
wealth while the country was wet?”</p>

<p>“You mean to say,” questioned Carl, “that individual
contributions are made to make the country
dry?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Where do you suppose these fanatics
get the money with which to carry on their lecture
tours and campaigns? They haven’t any money of
their own to speak of, and the government doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
pay them. The government has its own dry
crusaders.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” Carl resumed. “These private individuals
are making a good living by advocating, for
a price, the doctrine that it would be a good thing
for the welfare of the people and the country, if
they were deprived of a glass of beer or wine.</p>

<p>“I have no objection to the abolishing of strong
drink—such as brandy and whisky, but it is idiotic
hypocrisy to believe that a hundred million people
should change their custom overnight. Did you
ever think it over? If the customs of a nation can
be changed overnight, at the command of a few,
what sort of stuff must the people be made of?</p>

<p>“I can see where an individual here and there
could give up voluntarily a customary indulgence
for a short time, as we often do around New Year’s,
and then it is a matter of testing one’s power of will,
but it is beyond conception to believe that an entire
nation can be dictated to, and made to abide by a
law that makes it a crime to indulge in a glass of
four per cent. beer when the day before it was
within the law to consume one hundred proof.”</p>

<p>“No, Carl, you haven’t got that quite right!”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“You can drink all you want, or rather, can get.
All the liquor you, or any other wealthy and wise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
man, may have stored away in your cellar is yours
for the drinking. The law does not specify that you
must not drink it. It is not criminal to try it, but it
is illegal to sell or transport it to your home.”</p>

<p>“That is idiotic!” shouted Carl.</p>

<p>“But it is a fact,” came the retort.</p>

<p>“This would favor, no doubt, the well-to-do, who
are well able to pay the price of replenishing their
private stock.”</p>

<p>“Of course. The poor devil cannot afford a cellar
full. His stock at best, no doubt, is a flask on
his hip—if he has the coin, and then he runs the risk
of being arrested for having it on him. They could
even take his trousers away from him, if they felt
like living up to the very letter of the law. His
trousers would be termed the vehicle of transportation.</p>

<p>“That is the one reason why so much home-brew
is being made. Some of it would make a rabbit fight
a bulldog, but the people want it—and they pay the
price. As you know thousands have died drinking
the stuff.”</p>

<p>“Too bad. But what about our government which
caused this law to be passed?”</p>

<p>“It is responsible for all this misery, for the lawlessness,
that is seen on every hand. It is just as
much responsible for such conditions as England was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
when she forced upon China the use of drugs. You
know, China did not want the drugs, so England
warred upon her, with the result that millions of
Chinamen have died from the use of the drugs.</p>

<p>“Then, too, for years the unscrupulous Chinamen,
or his agents, sells the drug to the ever increasing
American trade. It is stated that since our country
became dry, more of the deadly drugs are used here
than in all other countries of the world combined.”</p>

<p>“And the government at Washington stands for
that? Impossible!”</p>

<p>“But what can they do? The government tries
to stop the smuggling of drugs into this country.
But as the people want the drug, either because of
the high cost of alcoholic stimulant, or the scarcity
of it, they are forever devising new schemes for
bringing it in, so that the government, while it does
prevent the smuggling of some of it, is unable to
prevent the drug from getting into the country.
Once in the hands of the peddlers in this country it
is an easy matter for it to be distributed among their
customers.</p>

<p>“And not only are they supplying old hands at
the game, but they are continually creating a new
demand, by teaching the habits to others. Why, we
read in the papers of school children and young girls
barely out of their teens using drugs. Were conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
the same before prohibition? No! You
didn’t hear of children getting drunk, and getting
drunk is wearing a halo compared to taking dope.</p>

<p>“If half the money used in the enforcement of the
dry law and the preaching of its propaganda was
spent in an earnest effort to rid this country of the
drug peril, there would be fewer jobs for keepers
in insane asylums.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Carl, “you are right there. And
thinking of it, it is not alone health that suffers from
such an evil. The nation will suffer in the end.
Look at China. Prior to the use of drugs, China
was a great nation. Some of the most useful of the
inventions of the ages have come from China.
What is it as a nation? The use of drugs made it
stagnant. Its culture died out and it ceased to be a
factor in the progress of the world. I wonder if
that was England’s object when she forced drugs
upon China. I understand, too, that in India, today,
more drugs are consumed than prior to England’s
taking hold there.”</p>

<p>“That may be so. You know a nation or a people
can be better exploited when in such a condition.”</p>

<p>“Well, let England do what it wants. The duty
of each and every American, however, is to look out
for the welfare of his country. He must remember
that America comes first and should do everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
possible to keep the American people from being exploited
either from within or without.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. But what do we want to do? It is
against the law to sell liquor, but not to drink it.
Come into the locker room, I have a little left.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a great life if you don’t weaken.”</p>

THE DEADLY RIVAL</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Carl reached his office, to take up
once more his engineering work he found
Grace already awaiting him, ready to
take up her secretarial duties.</p>

<p>When Grace had first expressed the desire to return
to New York, she confessed to a lack of funds.
Carl, grateful for the tender care she had taken of
him while he was ill at the hospital, offered to pay
her passage to New York. This she consented to,
with the stipulation that she be given work at his
office where a weekly deduction could be made from
her salary until the money he had advanced was repaid.
It was with this understanding, then, that she
accompanied Carl to New York.</p>

<p>Carl instructed her as to her duties, but did not
notice that her eyes seemed to flash with an eager
light and an avid gleam, such as the mere technique
of the work could never have provoked. She
seemed to bask in the favor of his presence and look;
to wither and wilt when he withdrew from her gaze,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
as a flower might do, if withdrawn from the light
and the glow of the life-giving sun.</p>

<p>While his business mail had been attended to during
his absence, quite a collection of personal mail
awaited him. He was too busy for the moment to
pay much attention to it and gave the envelopes but
a passing glance, as if looking for something of especial
interest or note. Not finding what he desired,
the entire lot was set aside for more leisurely perusal.</p>

<p>During the homeward journey, he had laid plans
for the irrigation of the Sahara, and with his assistant,
in his private office, he discussed the making of
these plans for a scientific irrigation system, to take
the place of the French plan for flooding the Sahara
by means of a canal from the ocean.</p>

<p>With this work thus auspiciously commenced,
Carl was at liberty to give more careful consideration
to his private matters, including that stack of
mail. On second thought, however, he waited until
the evening when the office force had left before he
sat down to the task.</p>

<p>The contents of the letters were practically all
alike, only that the meaning in each was differently
expressed, some were clever, some witty, some downright
dull. But Carl was used to that. Among them
were invitations to affairs that were already numbered
among the annals of the past and others of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
future time, which he made note of in anticipation
of attending them, if circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>He had started his plans for the Sahara irrigating
scheme, but with Sana gone there was not the same
enthusiasm and initiative as there was prior to that
fateful trip into the desert when they had been
trapped by Amshied and when he had so utterly
failed to play the hero, the rescuer of his beloved
one. The spur was gone. Again, there came to
him Sana’s promise that she would give anything
a woman could give to the man, who of course was
Carl, who saved her homestead at the Gurara Oasis.
But now she was dead and his desire to work on the
Sahara plan was likewise dying.</p>

<p>He cursed the hour when Sana and he, on the pretense
of requiring refreshments—while in reality it
was Sana’s desire to listen to the music, came to the
spot destined to prove so fateful. And after all, it
was but the monotonous tones issuing from the flute
of a snake charmer.</p>

<p>The minute attention Grace paid Carl in her first
week in the office, was not, in her mind, sufficiently
reciprocated—so she thought, although she realized
that she was but an employee. But had she not done
her level best to bring him back to health, when he
was lying prostrate in the hospital? That this was
her duty as a nurse, did not occur to her. She loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
Carl and was determined to secure his love. In what
way she secured it, did not matter to her. Well
she knew that Carl in paying her passage home had
unconsciously stepped into a trap, from which he
would have difficulty in extricating himself once the
meshes of the net had enfolded him. The Mann
Act deals severely with any offender, whose offense
comes within its provisions and Grace knew how
easy it would be to lend color to the story of her
passage home, even though it were an act of charity
on Carl’s part.</p>

<p>She did not care to entertain this thought, yet it
occurred to her mind time and time again when Carl
busily engaged appeared to be paying no attention
to her. His seemed an iceberg attitude, which made
her shiver. But she was ready to dig the flame out
of the ice.</p>

<p>For some time Grace had become anxious, fearing
that Carl knew or might come to know of the cablegram
she had withheld from him. Yet, how could
he learn of it? Did she not receive it early in the
morning, just after she had unlocked the office and
when she was entirely alone?</p>

<p>It was her duty to open the mail, telegrams and
the like. Thus she reasoned she had done no wrong,
insofar as reading the cablegram was concerned. But
to withhold it from her employer, even though she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
considered him more in the light of a friend and
even though it came from a woman she felt to be
her rival, equally if not more in love with Carl—was
this not a wrong of a hideous kind? Was it
not even branded with the name of crime?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>BELOVED CARL. I AM HOME AGAIN. NOTHING
SERIOUS HAPPENED. LETTER WILL FOLLOW.
YOUR LOVING AND LONGING SANA.</p>
</div>

<p>These were the words that flashed across the mind
of the guilty girl, whenever her eyes rested upon
Carl. They seemed to be graven on her mind in
letters of flame. To be near him in the taking of
his dictation was one of the uncertain pleasures of
her daily life. She knew that Carl had been deeply
in love with Sana, but she knew too that he believed
Sana was dead. At the same time that she feared,
she also was angered by the fact that Carl’s affection
even now seemed to be inevitably riveted upon a
thing which for him Death had long since claimed.
She, Grace, was still young and comely, yet he passed
her by in his worship at a shrine wherein the image
lay crumbling to the dust. This thought alone
caused the girl to pursue the course, which even to
herself was no source of joy, but a hideous curse,
and insidious menace that seemed to follow her as
a shadow even on the brightest day and as a blighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
curse even in moments that should have given a
small measure of joy and happiness.</p>

<p>To use the effect of the Mann Act as a stepping
stone, to gain her desires often occurred to her, but,
although she did not mind the notoriety attached to
it she did not know how to go about it other than
to openly accuse Carl. At this she balked. She
would bide her time. He did not know Sana was
alive and if she could help it, he would never know.
And who could tell but what with the passing of
the days Carl might turn to Grace for friendship.</p>

<p>The change in Grace became so obvious, that even
Carl was forced to take notice of it, but he could
not account for it.</p>

<p>Grace watched every incoming mail very closely,
for the cablegram had stated, a letter would follow.
That letter must never reach Carl, as that would
mean the failure of all her plans. No amount of
watching, no amount of worry, would be too great
a price, Grace reasoned, to pay for the opportunity
of getting that letter in her possession.</p>

<p>Then, at last, came the long watched-for missive!</p>

<p>There it lay on the desk before her, with its
African stamp and postmark. The woman’s hand
with which it had been addressed spoke plainly that
this letter was from Sana, Carl’s true love.</p>

<p>What should she do with it? Should she play the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
game squarely and place the letter on Carl’s desk
for him to read? The good in her made a vain
effort to fight down the evil. She would keep it.
Carl must not have it. No, a thousand times no!</p>

<p>All that day she kept the letter hidden at her
bosom. How it seemed to burn her flesh one moment
and freeze her very blood the next! It seemed
to Grace that it would shriek out its message to the
man from whom she was hiding it. But she did
not falter in her evil purpose. Although heart sick
and weary at the realization of her wrong, she clung
to it with grim resolve.</p>

<p>At last the day, the longest she had ever lived,
came to an end and she hurried home eager to read
that letter, but weighed down with a nameless fear,
with strange foreboding.</p>

<p>It was but the work of a moment to unseal the
envelope over the steam of a kettle. With feverish
haste, she drew out its contents, and read, half aloud,
with halting words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>My Beloved Carl:</p>

<p>I am home again with my mother, whom I found
before the charred cross you had erected over what
you thought was my grave. Dear heart, I was overjoyed
to hear that you were alive. I had thought
that the savage cavemen had done their worst to
you. When they carried me away, and later while
lying in their cave I prayed to God to receive your
soul with mercy. But now I am thanking Him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
having kept you alive. I can hardly believe it,
darling.</p>

<p>The cavemen held the slave-girl, Cintani and myself
captives for several days, but Cintani, she is a
clever one, managed to poison them, so that we escaped.</p>

<p>On our way home we came across de Rochelle,
who was almost dead with thirst and fever. Perhaps
I shouldn’t have done it, but I gave him water
and helped him to his feet. He came along with
us to the site of the burned cabin where mother was
praying for me. At the sight of me, she fainted
dead away. You can well imagine the shock it
would be.</p>

<p>De Rochelle has confessed that he set the place
on fire, trying to help us, and that he followed the
cavemen when they carried me off. This may be
true, but I do not believe him. At any rate, he has
promised to leave Timbuktoo as soon as he has
sufficient strength to do so. So don’t worry about
him, dear.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“In the desert a fountain is springing,</div>
<div class="verse">In the wild waste there still is a tree,</div>
<div class="verse">And a bird in the solitude singing</div>
<div class="verse">Which speaks to my spirit of thee.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I shall write you more in a day or two. At present
I am worn out and still too much excited in the
happiness and knowledge that my Carl is still among
the living. With heaps of love and kisses,</p>

<p class="right">Your Sana.</p>
</div>

<p>To this letter was pinned a short note to the effect
that, because of incorrect address on the first envelope,
the letter had been returned to her after some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
seven weeks had passed, and that she had promptly
readdressed it correctly and with the second sending
had also dispatched a cablegram.</p>

<p>Grace said to herself, “Poor thing, writing a
wrong address on a letter to her lover. However,
it finally found its destination. Here it is! And the
cablegram!”</p>

<p>As Grace read this loving message, her face grew
livid and her eyes expanded and contracted in her
rage. She rose up suddenly, exclaiming through
quivering lips, “Why couldn’t she have died, or that
caveman taken her. Then I should not have to
suffer now. Then she would have been out of my
way.”</p>

<p>For an hour she sat in the chair, where she had
thrown herself in a fit of rage, torturing herself with
cruel thoughts. But finally the madness died down,
and the look of hatred was replaced by one of utmost
depression and despair.</p>

<p>“What is the use? Sooner or later he will learn
that his desert flame is still burning.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Grace rose and replaced the
message within the envelope, sealing it carefully once
more. Yes, it would be for the best if she turned
it over to its rightful owner. With that thought in
mind she sought the comfort of her pillows.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, the good resolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
of the night before had paled. Grace seized upon
the letter and striking a match soon reduced Sana’s
message to a little heap of black fragments, saying
with a bitter laugh “Here goes Carl’s flame like the
will-of-the-whisp, flitting over the ground in its misleading
way, lasting but a little while.”</p>

<p>But Grace could not alter the ways of Fate or
Destiny! She might stave them off for the while,
but all her plans and wiles could not prevent them
from eventually rushing past her and on to the predestined
goal.</p>

<p>The days rolled by and still Grace bore her grudge
against Carl. In what strange actions love chooses
to express itself! And yet—did not the great
Alexander burn Persepolis, the Gem of the East, in
order to satisfy the whim of Thaïs, the courtesan?
Did not Antony lose the world to follow in the
footsteps of her who fled in vain back to her lost
empire—Cleopatra? Yes, these are the ways of
love and strange ways they are.</p>

<p>Grace assumed an outward attitude that did not
correspond with her feelings within. Whenever Carl
addressed her she replied in a kindly, gracious tone,
without hint of the madness that was eating away
her soul. Carl appeared to be more business like
and calculating than before. Often there were times
when she longed to tell him her innermost feelings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
but she could not bring herself to the point of doing
so.</p>

<p>And then Fate took a hand.</p>

<p>What had brought Carl to the office so early that
morning? Why should he have been there in the
outer office when the postman delivered a second
letter from Sana? Grace asked herself these questions
as reluctantly she passed the letter over to Carl.
He took it mechanically and not recognizing Sana’s
writing, laid the missive aside for a few moments
while he took up duties of greater importance to
him than any personal letter possibly could be.</p>

<p>His evident non-recognition of the missive struck
Grace rather forcibly as she watched him closely
from her desk. No opportunity presented itself
whereby she could secure this letter, and much to
her chagrin she was obliged to watch Carl at last
pick it up for reading.</p>

<p>He studied the stamp and the postmark, and as
he did so became very restless, excitably so and with
more than eager fingers he tore open the envelope.
A small slip of paper fluttered to the floor. Eagerly
he stooped to pick it up. Unfolding it his surprised
eyes were confronted with—</p>

<p class="center">HERE LIES MY BELOVED<br>
SANA VON SECKT<br>
REST IN PEACE<br>
<span class="gap">CARL</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>It was the note he had pinned to the charred cross
on Sana’s grave. His face grew pale, and scarcely
able to control his emotions he seized the letter itself
and unfolded it. As he did so he stared with eyes
that could not believe what they saw. He turned
at once to the signature and the pallor of his face
changed and gradually brightened while the fearsome
look in his eyes was changed to one of wonder
and joy. He read, scarcely breathing the while:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>My beloved Carl:</p>

<p>As I promised you, I am writing you more at
length now that I am at ease. I trust that my cablegram
and first letter found you in good health and
spirits, dearest darling boy.</p>

<p>I soon recovered from the experience I had in the
captivity of those strange cavemen, and my quick
recovery I ascribe to the joy of knowing that you,
my sweetheart, were not murdered in cold blood.
I went to church and thanked God for the wonderful
escape you had. The terrible agony I endured until
I met my mother kneeling before the cross, praying
for my soul, I can hardly describe. All that I care
about now is that you are safe.</p>

<p>I shudder when I think of how that caveman
struck you down with his club. You really had no
chance. And with that same club, while I was prisoner,
he tried to make love to me. It is hard for
me to realize today that such a brutal man should
have let me off so easily, but then I suppose I should
thank Cintani for this. She poisoned the entire
tribe, at least, so I think, as mentioned in my first
letter. When we escaped that night I took a last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
look at those cruel people and they were all lying
silently on the ground—a veritable court of the dead.</p>

<p>After all, I believe cavemen to a certain extent
are chivalrous to women. If it were not so, I would
not be alive today. I would have taken the poison
myself. You should have seen the way in which
those women loved their mates—yet their affection
is secured and held by the club. I wonder how it
would be if you were king of the cavemen? But
I suppose now that you are again in the company
of the New York girls you no longer care for your
“desert flower.” Was it after all, but a Fata Morgana
that we held in our arms while sitting on the
beach? Write me, dear, as I have been so lonesome
since you left. I feel as if I were standing alone
on a huge sand wave in the great desert, not certain
of my foundation.</p>

<p>But I do trust in you and I often thank our Lord
that He sent you to me to save my life. How can
I ever repay you? All I can give you is my devotion
and love. Love is life. So come to my arms.</p>

<p>Cintani, the little slave-girl, is staying at my home.
I am so grateful to her. If it had not been for
her pluck the chances are I should not now be
writing this letter.</p>

<p>De Rochelle, as I wrote you, will shortly leave
for France. My mother tells me he has recovered
his strength although I have not seen him since my
return.</p>

<p>He promised to stay away from me and so far
he has kept good that promise. To think that he
should have set Amshied’s place on fire while you
and I were there. He claims he did it to save me
from Amshied, but this is probably on the same par
with his desire to have me jump from the bridge.</p>

<p>I am enclosing herewith my tombstone inscription
“Here Sana, rest in peace....” As you now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
know you certainly did exaggerate. It is seldom that
one has the opportunity of reading the inscription
on one’s own gravemarker. But when I saw the
grave you had made, I could not keep from crying.
I want to tell you how I appreciate your kind manly
spirit. You are just wonderful and I wish we were
together now. But alas, I shall have to have patience.</p>

<p>With love and many kisses and regards from
mother, yours as ever,</p>

<p class="right">Sana.</p>
</div>

<p>Carl read the letter a second time. Then resting
back in his arm chair he smiled. And yet the close
observer might have perceived that his eyes were
veiled with a slight mist—tears of joy that welled
up from the soul.</p>

<p>Grace, who had been watching Carl closely, grew
furious, so much so, that she ground her teeth and
bit her lips until the blood appeared.</p>

<p>After Carl had again glanced over Sana’s message,
he placed it in his pocket and summoned Grace
into his private office to take dictation. Grace rose
unsteadily from her chair, believing that Carl would
dictate a message to Sana. That she determined,
she would not stand for. Then the thought flashed
through her mind that Carl surely would not expect
her to attend to his love affairs.</p>

<p>Carl commenced to dictate a business letter, but
his mind was far from the subject. Repeatedly he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
corrected himself and requested his secretary to read
and re-read the notes which she had taken down.
This mental disturbance in the usually fine poise of
her employer could not go by Grace unnoticed. It
served to anger her all the more to realize that his
love for Sana had the power to drive all else from
his mind and make him even oblivious to the duties
of his office.</p>

<p>Grace had read the letter back to him for the
fourth time when Carl, even in his confused mental
state realized that there was neither sense nor reason
in what he had dictated. So he decided to commence
again. A new beginning was made but that was
about all. At last with a thin and rather wan smile
he gave it up for the time being, dismissing his secretary
with the words “Never mind, just now. I
will get the letter out before five. Don’t fail to
remind me of it.”</p>

<p>A strange look had settled over Grace’s countenance
as she returned to her desk. A serious expression
it was, born of the thought of the withheld
cablegram and the purloined letter. She had suffered
far more in proportion to her doings than the
satisfaction she had derived from them.</p>

<p>Presently Carl entered her office and in a strangely
calm voice asked, “Miss Huntington, do you know
if there is another party in this building by the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
of Lohman? There was a cablegram and a letter
that I should have received probably some ten days
ago.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” was her rather quickly spoken
reply, and a flush that spread over her face, but
without any apparent hesitation she went on with
her work. Fortunately, Carl did not notice her embarrassment.</p>

<p>“It is very strange. I ought to be able to find
out the particulars of delivery at the cable office.
Would you be kind enough to drop in there on your
way to lunch and inquire if they have any record
for the last two weeks, or longer, of receiving and
delivering a cablegram for me from Timbuktoo,
Africa? You know, when they deliver a cablegram
the receiver must sign for it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, surely, with pleasure,” came with difficulty
from Grace’s pale lips and then momentarily summoning
courage, she added, “Were you expecting a
cablegram?”</p>

<p>“No, but I received a letter in which it was stated
that a cablegram had been sent.”</p>

<p>“Was it an important message?”</p>

<p>“Yes—and no.”</p>

<p>“Probably the sender confirmed the cable wording
in the letter you received this morning.”</p>

<p>Carl turned without an answer, as though he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
not heard this final remark and stepped into his own
office.</p>

<p>Her heart beat high, and fearfully she racked
her mind for some way out of the difficulty in which
she now perceived she had gotten herself. It would
never do to let Carl make any personal inquiries at
the cable office since then most assuredly she would
be detected in the game she had tried to play. Many
plans and schemes came to her mind but upon consideration
none appeared to answer her purpose.
As she murmured to herself, “I may as well take
the chance and pretend to have stopped there. He
would never know the difference and I can easily
report that no such cablegram had been received.”</p>

<p>Her lunch hour having arrived she prepared to
go out, and as she was putting on her hat, Carl
happened to pass and gave a parting caution, “Now
don’t forget about that cable.”</p>

<p>Her reply, “No I won’t,” was given in a rather
strange tone and she was thankful that Carl did not
appear to notice it. Hurriedly she left the office,
her entire body atremble. She did not go near the
cable office nor did she partake of her customary
ice-cream soda lunch. The fear that rose up within
her had robbed her of all desire to eat. Instead
she walked the streets, thinking, thinking.</p>

<p>Returning to the office a little later than usual she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
summoned her courage and at once went to Carl’s
private office.</p>

<p>In response to his eager and questioning look she
said, “There has been no such message received for
the past three months.”</p>

<p>This she figured, certainly covered the period
since Carl himself had left Timbuktoo, and continued,
“I had them look over all the books and
through all their files, and having done so, they were
positive that no cable of any sort had been received
for you from Timbuktoo or any other place in
Africa. In fact, you did not receive any foreign
messages since you returned from abroad.”</p>

<p>Carl turned away in silence, not knowing what
to make of it, but realizing all too well that the
cable might have gone astray.</p>

<p>Grace stood silently, noting carefully Carl’s every
gesture and expression, as she awaited a reply. He
dismissed her with apparently kindly spoken words,
“All right, never mind it then.”</p>

<p>As she left his office, she breathed much easier
and a great burden seemed to have been lifted from
her guilty soul. He suspected nothing!</p>

<p>A few minutes later however, Carl asked her for
a cablegram blank and instead of dictating the message
to her he wrote it out himself, and personally
rang for a messenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>When the messenger arrived, Grace, going to the
door of Carl’s office, said, “The boy is here Mr.
Lohman, will you give me the cablegram?”</p>

<p>“Send the boy in here.”</p>

<p>As the boy entered the office, Grace closed the
door behind him, remaining close outside in an effort
to hear what was said. But all she heard was
“Charge it.”</p>

<p>She went quickly to her desk and sat down as
the boy came out and departed through the outer
door. It occurred to her too late that she might
have gone out into the hall and demanded the message
from the boy and after having perused it,
handed it back to him with no one the wiser as to
her deception.</p>

<p>In her high-strung and nervous state, her mind
was not working as clearly as usual, or she surely
would have realized that she could have gone to
the cable office, at the end of the day, and for some
plausible reason, such as having failed to retain a
copy for the office file, procured a copy of the message.</p>

<p>Picking up her pencil and notebook she muttered
sadly, “Out of luck this time,” and entered Carl’s
office with the words “Mr. Lohman, you wished me
to remind you of that letter you desired to dictate
before the close of the day. Shall I take it now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“Ah yes, sit down and I will dictate at once.”</p>

<p>And, greatly to the surprise and chagrin, of
Grace, he, in the calmest manner imaginable, sat
back in his chair and dictated the long business letter
without a single halt or change. He was at ease,
mentally and physically, in great contrast with his
bewildered words of the morning.</p>

<p>It was the message he had sent to Sana that had
relieved his spirit and restored him to his normal
bearing.</p>

<p>It was Grace, who, if she had known the contents
of that cablegram, would have trembled and been
unfit to take the letter he was now dictating.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

GETTING HIS IDEAL MATE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER dinner that evening, Carl wrote a long
letter to Sana, enclosing the gift he had
purchased that afternoon. In higher spirits
than at any time since that fateful morning on the
desert he went to his club to spend the evening in
quiet reverie.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, the change in Carl
became more and more noticeable to Grace, who at
last realized that all her hopes were now gone as
the winds of yesterday. This realization was a bitter
pill to swallow but she tried to make the best
of it.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. Weeks that seemed ages to the
anxious man but weeks that were as fleeting moments
to the girl who dreaded the day when another letter
should reach him from across the seas.</p>

<p>At last the letter came. Receiving it from the
postman, Grace, without hesitation now, placed it on
Carl’s desk. What mattered it to her! But just
the same her feelings were thrown out of balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and with, “What’s the use,” she threw her notebook
angrily on her desk just as Carl came in with his
usual morning smile.</p>

<p>Grace made a brave attempt to appear unconcerned,
saying, “Mr. Lohman, there is a letter on
your desk from your African friend.”</p>

<p>Carl hurried into his office and as he opened the
envelope turned to Grace, asking, “How did you
know it was from Sana?”</p>

<p>“Oh I thought so.”</p>

<p>“Why, you did not know that she was alive.
How did you guess it?”</p>

<p>“To be frank, when you received the letter from
Timbuktoo and when you forwarded the cablegram,
I thought something unusual must have happened.
Isn’t that so?” looking at her chief with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right, Miss Huntington. I told
you that Sana had been burned to death, but I was
greatly mistaken. Sana is alive.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” came the lying response.</p>

<p>Carl was reading the letter for a second time,
when he was called to the telephone and while still
engaged in conversation over the wire, a business
friend dropped in requesting Carl to accompany him
up town, without delay, to attend to some important
business matters.</p>

<p>As they left the office, Carl informed Grace that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
he did not believe he would be back until late in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>Later on, Grace, when placing some papers on
his desk noticed Sana’s letter. Carl in his hurry had
forgotten to put it in his pocket as was his custom
with personal mail.</p>

<p>Without hesitation Grace picked up the letter and
returning to her desk, read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>My darling boy:</p>

<p>You cannot imagine how thrilled I was to get your
sweet note, saying that you are safe and happy and
to know that you still love me. I am, and I always
shall be yours. I am so hungry for you, my love.</p>

<p>The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose,
when you are once more with me.</p>

<p>Your message and the beautiful ring have removed
all doubts from my heart. Thank you, my
own.</p>

<p>You must have been in an extremely loving mood
when you wrote that letter, and looking at its date
I found that you wrote at a time when I could not
keep you out of my mind. I was longing, longing
for you, beloved. It must have been mental telepathy.
At any rate that very evening I removed
an old ring of mine, something told me to do it,
and sure enough with your letter came that wonderful
ring to take the place of the one I had discarded.
To think, dear, that you will be my very very own. I
wish you were here now so that I could better express
my feelings for you. But alas being so far
apart I can but press your picture to my heart and
lips. I am living in my dream of the future which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
like all great happenings, and like your sparkling
solitaire, casts its brilliant beams ahead.</p>

<p>You know I love you dearly and I hope the day
of supreme joy will soon come, when I shall register
a vow before God, you and myself, to devote my
life and love to you. I will be yours, yours—entirely
yours and you will be mine, all mine! Won’t
it be wonderful, too wonderful to believe?</p>

<p>As you read these lines I am longing, longing for
your embraces and caresses.</p>

<p>When thinking of you and the short sweet hours
we had together, the mirror reflects my eyes like
two bright stars of the desert night and I shall keep
them shining to lead you back across the desert to
your Sana.</p>

<p>Many thanks again, Carl, for the lovely surprises
of today.</p>

<p>Having now your splendid photograph to make
clearer my mental picture of you, I am reading your
character and writing down my observations and
comparing them with what astrology has to say.</p>

<p>This is my Carl—You are a keen observer, quick
in thought, practical, energetic, patient, good natured,
self controlled and determined. You are a
planner and a diplomat. The finely chiseled features
of your head and hands, as well as your silky hair
and fine skin show natural refinement, love of beauty,
harmony and quality. This is also proven by your
voice. Your forehead, nose and eyes, prove your
intellectual power.</p>

<p>Zodiac says: (Born between August 22nd and
September 23rd). You have a fine and discriminating
mind, great endurance and aptitude in acquisition
of knowledge. You are capable of attainments in
whatever line you undertake; but if you follow literary
pursuits or astronomy you will obtain decided
distinction. Whatever you do is done in an orderly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
systematic manner. You are fond of variety. You
possess great rallying powers and it would be hard
to keep you down. You are emotional, generous,
large hearted, fond of music and the arts. You are
instinctively discriminating, having likes and dislikes,
but do not care to be restrained or opposed in your
inclinations. You like things tasty, rich and elegant
but are still a strict observer of the rules of health
and nature.</p>

<p>While the stars say you are fond of art and tasty
things, they do not say you are fond of the feminine
sex. I suppose that those old astrologers who always
looked at that imaginary belt in the heavens
containing the twelve constellations of the Zodiac,
to forecast human destiny, did not care anything
about us women. So, this is my Carl!</p>

<p>Well, goodbye then for a while, with much love,</p>

<p>Your little girl of the desert,</p>

<p class="right">Sana.</p>
</div>

<p>Grace, having finished reading the letter, realized
that Sana was much cleverer than herself in expressing
her feelings, and able to say far more than she
would have ever attempted to put down on paper.</p>

<p>Comparing herself with Sana, Grace appeared to
herself as a hypocritical puritan. She hated herself
now for having let Carl slip away from her. Yet,
she no longer bore him any grudge. She realized
that he had treated her more kindly than she deserved.</p>

<p>It did not occur to her that the greater the intelligence
and culture of a person, the greater the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
expression and the appreciation of love. The less
intelligent cannot understand it. The lower the
plane, the less refined, the fewer and feebler are the
inner feelings. The imagination of women plays a
great role and it is just this that the dull unsophisticated
human being is unable to comprehend.</p>

<p>Even the mating of the intelligent with the dull
does not help the latter; it is beyond their power to
learn. That they miss joys of life, they cannot see,
or know why.</p>

<p>Society would do well to teach the public the true
meaning of love and the part it plays in the progress
of civilization. Unadvised, most people plunge
blindly and madly along, not realizing the truth and
heading straight for destruction. Much of this
could be avoided were we of today but properly
versed in the real meaning of life. Of course, such
teaching would deprive many so-called vice crusaders
and other self-appointed fanatical apostles of an
easy way to make a living, but the world would be
wiser and happier.</p>

<p>Carl was more than anxious now to have his
plans and specifications finished. Several weeks of
hard work went by quickly, then came the message
that made Carl forget all about engineering problems
and sent him hurrying across the ocean to
Sana’s side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Upon going to his office one morning he found
a cablegram awaiting him, telling him that von
Sarnoff and de Rochelle were causing Sana a great
deal of annoyance and that she wished he could come
to aid her in her distress.</p>

<p>Grace, too, had read the cablegram from Sana.
Although she had long realized that the man was
slipping through her fingers, she was determined now
to go to whatever extreme might be necessary to
obtain her end.</p>

<p>Once more the temptation of using the machinery
of the law, by means of the Mann Act, occurred to
her. Should she take advantage of it? The more
she studied the situation, the more promising did the
invoking of this law appear to her. Surely, she
mused, she was in a position to make things disagreeable
for Carl. Her word, she knew, would
carry more weight with the minions of the law than
his. His denials would be useless once she had
stated her case and started the wheels aturning.</p>

<p>Carl had certainly set the trap for himself when
he had refused to allow her to repay the money he
had advanced for her passage from Africa.</p>

<p>Grace could not refrain from laughing aloud as
she thought of this. At any rate, she figured, there
was enough against him to prevent his leaving the
country, at least for the time being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>And in the meantime what of Sana? If Carl
could not get to her side to protect her from de
Rochelle and von Sarnoff, they would, no doubt, take
care of her. With Sana out of the way, Grace saw
better chances for her own cause.</p>

<p>At her home that night Grace gave much thought
and consideration to the matter. Several schemes
came to mind, but at last she came to the conclusion
that it would best serve her purpose to consult a
lawyer.</p>

<p>She knew of no lawyer to whom she could entrust
her case, so at the office the following day, she
called up several of her girl friends, asking them
whether they knew any such lawyer. After a few
calls she was referred to one, as being just the sort
of counsel she should seek. Upon getting his office
on the ’phone she was asked to drop in during her
lunch hour to talk things over.</p>

<p>Grace told her side of the story, being careful
not to say anything with regard to the scheming she
had done to ensnare Carl in the meshes of her net.
Being pressed for time, on account of a case in court
that afternoon, the attorney asked that she return
that evening.</p>

<p>At the end of her office day, Grace again visited
the lawyer. After relating her story once more in
detail, Grace was assured that she had a good case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“I would advise that you sue him for at least
twenty-five thousand dollars,” the lawyer suggested,
craftily adding, “You can easily get several thousand
dollars anyway.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” questioned the girl, now quite
mercenary, at the thought of getting easy money.</p>

<p>“Yes—that is unless you happen to have something
in writing to hold against him.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing.”</p>

<p>“Too bad. If you did it would be worth a hundred
thousand to you.”</p>

<p>“A hundred thousand!”</p>

<p>“Yes, easily—but never mind, I can make it worth
your while, as it is.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure we have a good case against him?”</p>

<p>“Positively—when he paid your fare to this
country he committed a criminal offense, if we want
to look at it that way—and when it comes to a
show-down that is the way we look at it. He has
a year of imprisonment staring him in the face. I
believe it will be well worth his while to pay you
to keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“Yes”—replied Grace, thinking of Carl’s eagerness
to get to Sana, “I think he would.”</p>

<p>“Well then, do you want me to take your case?”</p>

<p>“Of course”—responded Grace. “Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“You know, without doubt, that the profession
cannot handle cases of this sort without a retainer
being paid in advance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see—what retainer would you like?”</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars. As soon as you pay it,
I shall proceed against Mr. Lohman. There will
be no notoriety attached; simply a case of making
him come across on the quiet.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t a thousand dollars,” Grace objected
faintly.</p>

<p>“No? Then I’m sorry that I cannot be of assistance
to you.”</p>

<p>Grace had had visions of fur coats and luxurious
gowns, purchased with the gold she and her attorney
would squeeze from Carl. Blackmail, you may call
it if you wish—but the nastiness of the name means
nothing in the life of a “gold digger.” Now those
fanciful dreams were fading from sight, just because
she did not happen to have a paltry thousand dollars
with which to satisfy the greed of the lawyer. She
called it greed, as she sat there, trying to find a
way out of the quandary, giving no thought to the
fact that even “gold diggers” are often “played” for
all they are worth.</p>

<p>The attorney, too, saw some easy money slipping
through his fingers, so turning to Grace he said, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
rather a patronizing tone, “Well—I could consider
five hundred.”</p>

<p>But that sum was just as unavailable as the first
and Grace hastened to tell him so, suggesting that
he take the case on a fifty-fifty basis.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” came the quick response. Although
he didn’t tell her, the lawyer wasn’t so positive
that they would get anything out of Carl, as
he had appeared to be in his conversation. Why
then, should he waste his time on a far fetched
gamble?</p>

<p>This outcome of her plans took Grace rather by
surprise. She had hoped to hold Carl by hook or
by crook, and failing to hold him, the next best thing
seemed the getting of some of his money. Now it
looked as if she would have neither the man nor
the gold. So far she had not struck “pay dirt” in
her gold digging.</p>

<p>But like all fortune hunters, one failure did not
mean utter disaster and rout to Grace’s plans.
There must be some way, she told herself, on her
way home. Yes, there must be a way and she
would sooner or later find it. Then she would show
Carl she was not to be trifled with! Suppose there
was notoriety and scandal connected with it. What
cared she? Like so many other women she would,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
no doubt, gain by it. And that alone was her object.</p>

<p>Luckily, Carl was entirely unaware of Grace and
her scheming. He had troubles enough of his own,
without being further burdened by any such menace
as blackmail.</p>

<p>He spent the day going from one steamship office
to another in an effort to book passage for an immediate
sailing to Africa. But his hunt was fruitless.
There were no vessels leaving for Africa
within a week—neither passenger nor freight.</p>

<p>The best he could do was arrange to go by boat
to Cadiz in Spain, trusting to his luck to be able
to secure quick passage from there on some coastwise
steamer, touching at different African ports.</p>

<p>Returning to his office he attended to a few of
the most important matters that required his personal
attention and prepared to leave. His baggage
was already on its way to the steamer, which sailed
the following morning. Before saying “goodbye”
however, he gave specific instructions as to the completion
of the competitive irrigation plans, and their
delivery to the New York office of the Sahara Development
Organization.</p>

<p>As Carl shook hands with Grace, she made a
brave attempt at smiling, saying, “Don’t forget to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
send us a wireless, so that I can meet you at the
dock when you return.”</p>

<p>After Carl had gone, and she was alone in the
outer office, Grace sank heavily into her chair, and
pointing her finger at the door through which he
had just passed, she muttered, through clinched
teeth, “I’ll get you yet. Yes, I’ll be at the dock
when you return, all right. And what will happen
then will be some surprise to you and your desert
vamp.”</p>

<p>When one is in a hurry, delay sets in. Such were
Carl’s thoughts when the hour of sailing had long
passed, and still the steamer remained in her berth.
But all delays come to an end sometime, and at
noon the vessel was warped from the dock, and soon
Carl was waving a farewell to New York’s skyscrapers.</p>

<p>As the boat steamed out to sea, Carl thought of
the rum-runners he had encountered on his last trip.
He wondered whether the boats he saw on the horizon
were of that calling. But these were but passing
fancies. His thoughts were in Africa, beside a little
lake and of a girl, who even now might be in grave
danger.</p>

<p>The passage to Spain was a slow one it is true,
but to Carl it seemed as if they would never get
there. The hours of sea travel became days in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
fancy and the days ages. Every low-lying cloud
bank, he prayed meant land, and when it proved
otherwise, he cursed the fact that he did not have a
real “Meteor,” like the one of his dream, at his
disposal.</p>

<p>At last Cadiz hove in sight. Assured by the
Captain of the steamer he had come over on, that
he could get passage on a freighter or cattleboat
engaged in trade along the African coast, he hurried
from the ship and immediately sought the offices of
the steamship people named by the Captain.</p>

<p>Luck smiled kindly on him. There was a vessel
leaving that day, destined to Spanish Africa. It
was a tramp freighter, but it seemed a floating palace
to Carl.</p>

<p>On board, Carl made plans on how to reach Timbuktoo
in the quickest possible way. The steamer
would take him to Senegal. From there he could
take the railroad that runs along the Senegal River,
for some eight hundred miles, into the African interior.
So far so good. At the terminus of the
railway, however, he faced a journey of some three
or four hundred miles on horseback. That was the
part he dreaded. As good a horseman as he was,
he realized the strain such a journey would place
upon man and beast, especially so if they were in
a hurry. But the journey itself did not worry him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
as much as the procuring of sufficient relays of horses
to carry on.</p>

<p>Slow as the trip across the Atlantic had seemed,
the passage of the freighter along the African Coast
was still slower and more tedious.</p>

<p>Languidly the vessel crept from port to port.
Being a tramp her holds held a general cargo consigned
to hundreds of different points in the interior
of the continent, which meant a stop at a half dozen
different coast towns. The mere calling at these
varied ports would not have displeased Carl as much
as did the fact that the Captain of the boat saw
fit to lay-up at each of the ports for a day or two.
To plead with him for a more hurried journey was
useless. He had made the trip a half hundred times,
he told Carl, and it was always fast enough to suit
him. And when an African coaster says that, he
means it.</p>

<p>Carl was desperate, when, one rainy morning,
some four weeks after leaving New York, he finally
left the steamer at the port of Saint Louis, lying at
the mouth of the Senegal River.</p>

<p>Inquiring at the railroad station as to the first
train for Segu Sikoro, the last stop, on the road he
was told that it would be some hours before the
train left.</p>

<p>Cursing the indifference to time one encounters all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
over Africa, Carl turned to a little telegraph office,
and from there dispatched a message to Sana, saying
he was on his way to Timbuktoo, and hoped to see
her within a week.</p>

<p>At last the train started its weary journey up the
Senegal River. Carl had never traveled on an
African railway, but, from what he had heard of
the experiences of friends, it was something not to
be considered in the light of a pleasure trip. Just
how many stops it would make from time to time,
for water and wood it used for fuel, he dared not
picture in advance. Suffice to say, they would be
too many to suit anyone in as great a hurry as he
was.</p>

<p>From the outset the trip promised to be an unpleasant
one. The rain and the heat, together with
the swarming flies, foretold as much.</p>

<p>Carl tried to concentrate on his books, but after
a few hours dreary ride, punctured by several jerking
stops, and accompanied by shrieking wheels, he
gave it up. He would just have to sit there and wait
for his journey’s end.</p>

<p>So he sat looking out through the rain at the
dismal waters of the Senegal, until the train came
to a halt at a little way station, the name of which
Carl could not ascertain.</p>

<p>Here he was joined, in way of company, by a tall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
rugged fellow, wearing tweeds that looked totally
out of place in that part of the country.</p>

<p>As Carl looked up, the newcomer nodded pleasantly,
remarking as he did so, “Beastly weather,
this.”</p>

<p>Carl, glad to get in conversation, replied to this
greeting with a pleasant, “Fine for ducks.”</p>

<p>The other, settling his bulky figure into the seat
opposite Carl, proceeded to fill and light his pipe,
saying—“Not supposed to, you know, but I’ve never
been stopped yet—Smoke?” offering his tobacco
pouch.</p>

<p>“Yes thanks, I will,” and Carl, too, was soon
wreathed in a cloud of pipe smoke.</p>

<p>They sat silently for a time, each studying the
other, when Carl, anxious to renew the conversation,
said “From your remarks, I take it you have traveled
this road before.”</p>

<p>“Many a time. Guess I know every inch of it
and each different shriek in the wheels. By the way,
name is Rogers—trader and so on.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s Lohman, engineer from New York.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Lohman,” from the other,
who, it was apparent, did not believe much in the
formalities. Of this Carl was glad. Here was a
man he could talk to without having to watch his
step every inch of the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>The other continued, “You won’t mind my rudeness,
I hope—but would you mind my asking what
you are doing here?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Carl; “and I’ll answer you
too. I’m trying to get to Timbuktoo in a hurry.
And I’m sorry to say that ‘hurry’ seems to be the last
thing thought of here.”</p>

<p>“You have a long way to go, friend.” Rogers
paused for a moment, then continued with “How
are you going on from Segu Sikoro?”</p>

<p>“I intended to go by horse if possible, but for
the last few hours I have been worrying as to how
I can get the horses.”</p>

<p>“Well you would have good cause for worry if
you hadn’t met me. But having met me, you need
not worry.”</p>

<p>To Carl this sounded like bragging, but he felt,
from within, that the man was sincere.</p>

<p>Without waiting for Carl to say anything, Rogers
added “My place is but a few miles from the station,
and a servant will be waiting for me with a buckboard.
If you will accept my offer, I can fit you
up.”</p>

<p>“I shall be greatly indebted to you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, friend. My motto is ‘Help others—you
may need help some day.’ I’m not asking
questions as to what you are in a hurry about and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
I don’t want you to tell me, either. All I know is
you are in a hurry and that’s enough for Rogers.”</p>

<p>Carl was no fool, and realizing the offer was made
in good faith readily accepted it.</p>

<p>In due time they reached the railhead, and as
predicted by Rogers, his servant was there, waiting
to take him home. He hustled Carl into the wagon
and away they went at a lively pace.</p>

<p>Rogers, turned to Carl, laughing and remarked
“Some speed in Africa, according to where you look
for it.”</p>

<p>After a half hour’s drive across the grassy plains
they swung through a grove of trees, arriving shortly
at the great palatial house Rogers called home.</p>

<p>Inside, Rogers called for whisky and soda, after
which he led Carl to the bath where he could rid
himself of the dust of the journey. It was then late
in the afternoon, and although Carl was anxious to
be on his way, he could not refuse the invitation to
remain overnight.</p>

<p>Dawn, the following morning, found Carl up and
dressed, after a night of refreshing sleep and rest.
Rogers was up before him, however, and had seen
to it that breakfast was on the table when his guest
came downstairs.</p>

<p>While eating, Rogers outlined his plan to Carl.
A native servant, who knew the country as only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
native can, would accompany Carl the entire distance.
They would take two of Rogers’ best saddle
horses and ride to a distant ranch. There they
would be given fresh horses for the next stage of
the trip. Rogers explained that they would have to
go a little out of their way, but they would make
better time by having fresh horses for about every
hundred miles.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Rogers led Carl out of doors,
where the guide and the horses were already awaiting
him.</p>

<p>Thanking Rogers for his assistance and assuring
him of his gratitude, Carl mounted, and following
the guide rode speedily away. As he did so, he
heard Rogers call after him “Don’t forget to let
me know if you find the girl safe.”</p>

<p>“How the devil did he guess it?” Carl mused.
“There certainly are strange folk in this world.”</p>

<p>Hour after hour they rode silently. The horses
seemed to realize the urgent need of speed and
every tendon was strained as they galloped along,
placing the miles rapidly behind them. The sun
rose high overhead and sank in the distant west
and still the two men rode, urging their mounts on
and on. Twilight, the short misty African twilight,
came and was swallowed by night, and yet there was
no halting in the ride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>The moon of midnight saw the weary men drop
from their more weary horses at the first stopping
place, a little ranch run by a friend of Rogers. The
baying hounds had awakened the owner, who came
out to see what caused the disturbance. Recognizing
Rogers’ man, he took them into the house, and
being told that Rogers desired that they be given
fresh horses the following morning, he assured them
that Rogers’ wish was his pleasure, and made haste
to make the travelers comfortable for the night.</p>

<p>The following day was much the same as the one
previous. All day they rode and far into the night.
They came at last to a little lake, which Carl thought
he recognized as Faguibin, but to his chagrin the
guide informed him that Faguibin was still a long
distance away.</p>

<p>They stayed overnight at a lonely ranch, and set
out, once more, the following morning, before the
sun had risen above the horizon, on the last stage
of their ride. Again good fortune favored them
and without mishap their horses fairly flew over the
remaining miles.</p>

<p>Weary to the point of exhaustion, Carl fairly
staggered, late that night, into Sana’s home.</p>

<p>But Sana was not there to greet him. Her mother
informed him, between her tears, that Sana had disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
the day before while out riding. Where
she was she did not know. All she knew was that
Sana was not to be found in the village, and that
she believed Sana had been spirited away by someone
in the employ of de Rochelle.</p>

<p>She directed Carl to the hotel where von Sarnoff
was staying, saying that he was getting up a searching
party and that no doubt, he would assist Carl
in anything he would do to find the lost one.</p>

<p>“Von Sarnoff?” cried Carl, “I thought he, too,
was annoying Sana?”</p>

<p>“He was in the beginning, but when he learned
the truth from Sana, he ceased bothering her, and
since then has been only trying to protect her from
de Rochelle.”</p>

<p>With the words—“All right, I’ll see him,” Carl
rushed from the house and hurried to the hotel.</p>

<p>Making himself known to von Sarnoff, Carl
sought his aid. Gladly was the request granted. The
searching party would start out early the following
morning, Carl was informed, and as von Sarnoff expressed
it, they would find Sana even if they had
to sift the desert sands.</p>

<p>No time was lost the next day in getting away
on the search. As they proceeded, von Sarnoff told
Carl that he had learned that the local telegraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
operator had been bribed by de Rochelle and had
handed Carl’s message to Sana over to him.</p>

<p>The village had been searched thoroughly for
Sana, and the leader of the searching party directed
the party to the jungle that lies close to the town,
believing that it was there that de Rochelle would
take his captive. Sana was too well known and too
well liked in Timbuktoo for de Rochelle to risk
keeping her, against her wish, anywhere in the city.</p>

<p>All that day the little group of searchers beat the
bush, but in vain; Sana was not to be found; nor
were they even sure that the hoof prints they saw
in the soft soil were those of the fugitives.</p>

<p>Too late to continue, they camped for the night
in the deep jungle, lying huddled on the ground,
trying as best they could to keep warm. They
dared not build a fire for fear it might warn de
Rochelle, if he were near, that he was being followed.</p>

<p>Long before dawn Carl roused the party and
again the search was on. No light was thrown on
the trail until about noon one of the hunters found
a hat. Von Sarnoff, rushing to the spot cried—“Lohman—it
is Sana’s hat—we are on the right
road after all.”</p>

<p>But as the day went by, their hope of finding Sana
grew less and less. They were getting into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
thickest of the jungle, which they were experiencing
great difficulty in penetrating.</p>

<p>Wearily they pushed their way through thorn and
underbrush, becoming more and more discouraged
as the hours flew by.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to their startled ears, came the panic
stricken shrieks of a woman and the wild snorting
of a horse.</p>

<p>There was no holding them now. No brush grew
thick enough to keep them from hurrying to the spot
from which the cries had seemed to come.</p>

<p>They had not gone far, when, with a great crashing
of branches, a madly galloping horse plunged
past them.</p>

<p>“Good God!” Carl gasped as he recognized Sana’s
white Arab. As the horse careened by, the watchers
saw hanging from his torn and bleeding neck, a
black panther.</p>

<p>Again the screams resounded through the jungle
depths.</p>

<p>Throwing all caution to the winds Carl plunged
ahead. Entangling vines, scratching thorns and
bruising branches strove to hinder him. But he was
unmindful of all these. Nothing mattered! He
must get to Sana, it was she who had torn the silence
with her cries.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>Von Sarnoff hurried after him, but Carl was first
to reach a little clearing in the jungle. A wild cry
escaped his lips as he beheld the strange sight before
him.</p>

<p>Sana was tied hand and foot to a tree. At her
feet lay a heap of twigs. Had de Rochelle dared
dream of torture? The question came to Carl, as
with clenched fists, he turned to look for de Rochelle.
He must answer for that outrage.</p>

<p>But de Rochelle was beyond answering for the
misdeeds of his life. At the opposite edge of the
clearing lay what was once a man. Tearing savagely
at the body, stood the mate of the panther that had
attacked the horse. Sensing danger, the beast raised
its head to glare at Carl, its tail swishing angrily.</p>

<p>Calling to von Sarnoff “Take care of that beast!”
Carl sprang to Sana’s side and freed her from her
bonds. She had fainted on seeing him at the edge
of the clearing, and he picked her up tenderly, whispering,
softly, “All is well, beloved.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile von Sarnoff with a well directed shot
had laid the panther low.</p>

<p>Holding his sweetheart in his arms, Carl saw the
dismal jungle brightened with the rays of the setting
sun, as Sana recovered consciousness and with a cry
of joy embraced him, realizing that she was safe at
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>The world may be but a Fata Morgana and life
an illusion to those who keep not the faith, but to
those who tend the fires of truth, the rays of the
setting sun shall be messengers of Peace.</p>
